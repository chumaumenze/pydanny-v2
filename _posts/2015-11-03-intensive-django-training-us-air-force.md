    It was a challenging, exciting experience for us as instructors. We've
    taught numerous Python and Django trainings over the years under
    <a href="http://www.cartwheelweb.com/training/" target="_blank"
      >Cartwheel Web</a

    , but this was the first time we taught as
    <a href="http://www.twoscoopsacademy.com" target="_blank"
      >Two Scoops Academy</a
    >
    using our new system of instruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The environment that the 91st Cyberspace Operations Squadron works in is
    heavily isolated from the internet. What this means is that until technology
    or information is approved, it is unavailable to the software developers.
    While they can access Google, Stack Overflow, and Read the Docs, reading the
    source on GitHub is something they do at home, not on the job. This means
    they really need to understand their material. Our experience with their
    team (already competent in other programming tools) was that they were
    bright, focused, and willing to learn.
  </p>
  <p>The class included material on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Python, PEP8, PEP20, object oriented programming</li>
    <li>Django and related best practices</li>
    <li>Class-based views, ModelForms, and Forms</li>
    <li>Using third-party Python/Django components</li>
    <li>
      Bootstrapping projects with
      <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter" target="_blank"
        >Cookiecutter</a
      >
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django" target="_blank"
        >Cookiecutter-Django</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>PostgreSQL, pgAdmin III, and PyCharm's database tools</li>
    <li>PyCharm settings, debugging, testing, and coverage integration</li>
    <li>Bootstrap, SASS, CSS, and Grunt</li>
    <li>Simple and advanced version control workflows with Git</li>
    <li>APIs with Django REST Framework</li>
    <li>Django project deployment with Docker</li>
    <li>Custom material as requested by the US Air Force</li>
    <li>Much more</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We readily admit taking our course material is like receiving a firehose of
    knowledge to the face; that large portions probably won't make sense for
    months. Yet as always with smart students, we could tell that the core
    concepts of our curriculum were sticking.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the afternoon of the last day we switched to "project" mode, where
    the class breaks up into small teams to begin trying to resolve various
    in-house challenges. To our delight, challenges were completed and real
    progress was made. As instructors, nothing is more exciting than seeing your
    students succeed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The class ended on a high note, but as always I'm sad that it's over. Our
    host, Captain
    <a href="https://twitter.com/jondelmil" target="_blank"
      >Jonathan D. Miller</a
    >, was gracious and accommodating. The students were friendly and willing to
    learn. I'm grateful to have taught them on

    Here are some kind words that we received about the training we provided:
  </p>
  <em
    ><p>
      “Daniel and Audrey just ran the most effective, focused training course
      I've had the pleasure of attending. They worked tirelessly with me in the
      months leading up to the course so that it was tailored specifically for
      our squadron's development environment, and they followed up afterward to
      ensure that their slides were flawless for our continued reference.

  <p>
    At several points during the course, my developers took me aside to mention
    to me how impressed they were with the Greenfelds' quality of instruction,
    preparation, and attention to detail. Having two instructors was a true
    force multiplier -- we covered more ground on Python and Django than I
    thought possible. After four days we were already building working
    prototypes of our desired applications, and many in the class had never
    touched Python before!
  </p>
  <p>
    Our squadron's return on investment for this course was remarkable. Daniel
    and Audrey have my strongest endorsement, and I know the 91st COS will be
    sending future developers.”
