<p>This blog post got started with a tweet.</p>
<p>That tweet got retweeted a lot by developers. And system administrators.
And database administrators. And any creative type.</p>
<p>As of December 7th, 2012, it had been retweeted over 500 times, a
personal best. Obviously I struck a chord that resonated with a lot of
people.</p>

<h1 id="why-did-this-tweet-resonate-with-so-many-people">Why did this tweet resonate with so many people?</h1>
<p>What I said in that tweet was not new - dozens if not hundreds of others
have tweeted similar thoughts before and gotten many retweets. Heck,
it's been written about in blogs and articles for years, either as a
huge rant or often as an effort to politely educate others on how to set
up a developer/operations/creative shop.</p>
<p>I think this is because developers/engineers/creatives (and good
managers) know that even a tiny distraction to someone "in the zone"
takes more than just the 3-5 minutes it takes for you to finish a
question and get an answer. Plus, because you are trying to remember the
pieces in your head, you won't be able to give this issue your full
attention. Which causes a whole other set of issues.</p>
<p>We know this. Good managers know this. Good companies live off of it.</p>
<p>And yet this remains a huge problem for many of us because the
distractions keep happening. Maybe it's because your manager doesn't
understand this issue, or you have a team mate who can switch in-and-out
of the zone with impunity. Or because you foolishly leave the
chat/IRC/phone on and you get pinged.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-we-fix-it">How do we fix it?</h1>
<p><strong>We can't.</strong></p>
<p>I know this sounds depressing, but I'm being realistic. Here's some
reasons that apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless you are fortunate enough to be working on a solo effort, you
are working with other developers/engineers/creatives. And if they
can't ask you questions or inform you about critical stuff then you
or they can waste hours.</li>
<li>Meetings, short or long, online or in person, are a necessary part
of any operation. If not with your boss or underlings, then with
clients or users.</li>
<li>Your boss/co-workers/underlings/kids/pets/parents don't get it that
you can't be interrupted.</li>
<li>As a freelancer, you can't be inaccessible to existing or potential
clients.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="no-really-how-do-we-fix-it">No really, how do we fix it?</h1>
<p>Doesn't matter how frequently you ask the the question (or rant about
it), I don't believe this problem can be really solved. However, here
are some possible mitigations:</p>
<p><strong>1. Maker's Day</strong></p>
<p>My friend, <a href="http://craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/07/how-heroku-works-maker-day/" target="_blank">Craig
Kerstiens</a>
describes how <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a> gives engineers a full day
each week (Thursday) to focus on getting stuff done. No meetings, no
standup, just 100% uninterrupted quiet time to focus on making stuff.</p>
<p>Suggest this at your company and see how it goes!</p>
<p><strong>2. Blocks of Time</strong></p>
<p>As of 2010, <a href="http://eldarion.com" target="_blank">Eldarion</a> broke up their work day into
at least two sizable chunks of uninterrupted activity. Between the
chunks you communicated with co-workers. The advantage of this approach
is if you went down the wrong path or someone had a critical question,
the period between chunks addressed this issue.</p>
<p>In theory this is how a lot of places work (lunch being the break). The
reality is that the distractions often still pile in. For Eldarion it
worked because everyone was remote.</p>
<p><strong>3. New Desk Location</strong></p>
<p>If working at an office, asked to be moved to a place with less foot
traffic. The downside to this is you can end up in noisy, cold, dark
places.</p>
<p><strong>4. New Job</strong></p>
<p>Switch to a new job that promises less distractions.</p>
<h1 id="maybe-im-wrong">Maybe I'm wrong</h1>
<p>I'm more than happy to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a way to get 4-6 hours a day of uninterrupted maker's
time every work day.</p>
<p>If you've got any ideas, let me know!</p>
