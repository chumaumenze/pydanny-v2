    The PyCon US 2013
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp/" target="_blank"
      >call for papers (CFP)</a
    >
    ends tomorrow, September 28th, 2012. We need more talk and tutorial
    submissions. Talks are 30 or 45 minute efforts in front of the PyCon
    audience and are recorded for posterity. Tutorials are three hours long and
    are given to attendees who have paid an additional fee in order to slurp in
    knowledge from the masters.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the 3 hour tutorial side of things,
    <strong>we especially need more Intro to Python level submission</strong>.
    That means getting beginners up to speed on basic Python techniques, so they
    can then exploit the other tutorials, conference, and sprints to their full
    advantage.

    1. I would like to give a tutorial but it's so much work to put together 3
    hours of quality content.
  </h2>
  <p>
    The organizers of PyCon recognize that putting together a quality tutorial
    is an amazing amount of work. Which is why tutorial presenters are
    compensated for their effort.
  </p>
  <h2
    id="2-what-is-the-most-likely-length-talk-to-be-accepted-30-minutes-or-45-minutes"

    2. What is the most likely length talk to be accepted? 30 minutes or 45
    minutes?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The vast majority of PyCon sessions are 30 minutes long, so 45 minute slots
    are rare and valuable commodities. So if your talk needs to be 45 minutes
    long your proposal has to really speak to the PyCon talk reviewers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only that, if reviewers send you information requests for any duration
    talk or tutorial,
    <strong
      >you dramatically increase your odds of talk acceptance with timely
      responses</strong
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, as said before, PyCon really needs more
    <strong>introductory level Python tutorial</strong> submissions.

    3. I would like to present a talk or tutorial but I can't afford to come to
    PyCon.

    4. I would like to present but I can't come up with a good idea!
  </h2>
  <p>
    I had this problem as well! Then I looked at the
    <a
      href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/tutorials/suggested_topics_2012/"
      target="_blank"
      >Suggested Tutorial Topics</a

    and got some ideas.

    5. Ack! I've got a talk idea but it's going to take me too much time to put
    it together!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Submit the talk anyway before the talk and in fields you aren't ready to
    fill in, simply put '<strong>TBD</strong>'. Then over the course of the next
    few days replace TBD with real material. Don't wait too long though to fix
    those TBDs, no more than a week!
  </p>
  <h2
    id="6-im-a-beginnernobody-in-the-community-is-there-any-chance-my-proposal-will-get-accepted"

    6. I'm a beginner/nobody in the community, is there any chance my proposal
    will get accepted?
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Absolutely!</strong></p>
  <p>
    The PyCon talk/tutorial reviewers love to see new people present. While
    experienced/proven speakers have an edge, good talk/tutorial proposals from
    promising candidates <strong>can</strong> make it into the conference.
    Carefully double-check your submission, be responsive to reviewers, and stay
    positive. I'm not saying you will get in, but I am saying it's worth the
    effort.
  </p>
