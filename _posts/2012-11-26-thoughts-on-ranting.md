    I'll admit it, I love a good rant. I respect those who can give rants well.
    I would list the ones I really like, but I'm not sure I want to deal with
    the arguments that would follow. ;-)
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, as much as I like to read or listen to them, I also like to give
    them. As of 11/26/2012 there are 2 on this
    <a href="https://pydanny.com/tag/rant " target="_blank">blog</a> and 26
    on my
    <a href="https://pydanny.blogspot.com/search/label/rant" target="_blank"
      >old blog</a
    >.

    Unfortunately, I have a problem in giving rants. It ties with this
    unfortunate trait I possess where if I let myself get angry I say things
    that destroy relationships. No, I'm not giving examples, but there you are.
  </p>
  <p>
    So when I do rant, I try to never do so in anger. Especially when it's the
    written word. Instead, I try to do so under one of the following conditions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I need to be a whimsical mood.</li>
    <li>OR I need to be willing to submit a solution.</li>
    <li>
      OR I need to be willing to accept a solution, even if it means work.
    </li>
    <li>OR I need to be willing to create a solution.</li>
    <li>OR the object of the rant must be an easy target to flame.</li>
  </ul>
