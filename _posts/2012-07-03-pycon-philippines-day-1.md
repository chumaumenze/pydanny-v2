    (PyCon PH) happened just this past weekend at the
    <a href="http://www.upd.edu.ph/" target="_blank"
      >University of the Philippines Diliman</a
    >
    (UP Diliman) campus in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quezon_City" target="_blank"
      >Quezon City</a

    >.

  <p>
    I can assure you that PyCon PH was an wonderful, amazing, humbling
    experience. I'm hoping that this post and others will get across to you why.

  <h1 id="arrival">Arrival</h1>
  <p>
    Frank Pohlmann, chairman of PyCon Philippines picked us up and drove us to
    the event. He had worked day and night getting the event ready, all the
    while running his company, working a job, and being a father to his lovely
    21 month old daughter.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we arrived at the venue, Audrey and I were met by our good friend,
    Filipino-American Bryan Veloso of Github, who was to provide the closing
    keynote. As soon as Bryan heard that there was going to be a PyCon in the
    Philippines he gave up his trip to Europython to be a speaker at PyCon PH.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inside the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, we were
    greeted Ann Tan-Pohlman, logistics co-chair and volunteer organizer. She had
    over a dozen volunteers getting ready for the oncoming flood of registrants.

    in a forthcoming blog post.

    We noticed a large group gather by a side corridor and went to say hello.
    There we met
    <a href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez" target="_blank">Sony Valdez</a>,
    President of
    <a href="http://www.13hq.com/" target="_blank">Agoo Computer College</a>,
    and forty of his faculty and students. They were buzzing with energy and
    excitement, belying the fact that they had left at midnight the night before
    in order to arrive on time (they traveled many hours by bus). Audrey, Bryan,
    and I were floored by their effort to educate themselves, and were
    determined in our speeches not to disappoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the majority of the Agoo Computer Science had to go in the
    middle of the afternoon.
    <strong>We didn't know they had to go until it was time to leave</strong>.
    Next year I plan to do whatever is possible to help them come for the
    duration of the conference.

  <p>
    After the national anthem, the Dean of Computer Science, Adrian Roy Valdez,
    started the event with a few words. Frank Pohlmann, PyCon PH chair thanked
    everyone involved including the sponsors, speakers, and especially the
    attendees. I gave a keynote speech I'll blog about shortly, and then it was
    time for the talks.

  <p>
    Paulo gave the Intro to Python talk. He was burdened by some equipment
    issues, but kept going undeterred. It reminded me of the first time I spoke
    at PyCon 2010, when for the first 10 minutes of my talk they couldn't get
    the projector to work. In any case, Paolo did a great job under very trying
    conditions.

  <p>
    Audrey summarized a lot of the really important things you need to know in
    Python but aren't part of an introductory talk. Things like pip and
    virtualenv, how to construct packages, basic use of PyPI, and hammered home
    the need for good documentation. I may be partial, but I think this was the
    best version of this kind of talk ever given. :-)

    Marconi built off what Audrey provided, and added to it by giving a good
    introduction to Django. He also contributed a lot during the sprints the
    next day by pitching in with beginners. His talk featured code for a simple
    TODO app, and you can see the working example at
    <a href="http://quickstart.marconijr.com/" target="_blank"

  <p>
    Sony Valdez, who I mentioned earlier, gave a talk on pygame and math while
    wearing the Barong Talalog. Not just any talk on pygame, but the best one
    I've ever seen. He's a natural speaker and educator, and extremely funny.
    And while giving this amazing talk on no sleep (remember - he was on a bus
    with 40 of his students and faculty), he broke many classic presenter rules:
  </p>
  <p><strong>1. Live code demo</strong></p>
  <p>
    He wrote a functioning game while giving this talk. He made his mistakes
    part of the talk.
  </p>
  <p><strong>2. Used notepad</strong></p>
  <p>
    That's right. He didn't use Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, or PyCharm. He used
    notepad.
  </p>
  <p><strong>3. Someone else's laptop</strong></p>
  <p>
    He used an unfamiliar computer for his talk. Ever try and type on a keyboard
    you aren't familiar with? This is what he was dealing with while after a 5+
    hour bus journey with probably no sleep the night before.
  </p>
  <p>I'm in awe.</p>

    Sony was a hard act to follow, but Malcolm gave an amazing rendition of his
    classic talk on functional programming. I've seen Malcolm give this talk
    before, but this instance was clearly the best.

    What's a python conference without one talk about system engineering?
    Fortunately for us, Rodney gave a talk on
    <a href="http://ansible.github.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>, a pretty
    new Python based deployment tool. What makes Ansible different is it's range
    of options, and simplicity of use.

    Paulo Barazon returned to talk about the big users of Python, how to promote

    Bryan closed out the day with an inspirational and funny keynote speech
