    On October 16th, 2011, which was one hundred and sixty-four days before I
    published this post, I resolved to get myself onto the Longest Streak list
    of
    <a href="http://calendaraboutnothing.com/" target="_blank"
      >Calendar About Nothing</a
    >. Today, with this blog post, I've managed to do just that - get on the
    Longest Streaks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Calendar About Nothing tracks your open project commits on
    <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>. It tallies your
    total number of days, records your longest streak, and lets you compare
    yourself against other committers. The idea comes from an
    <a

      target="_blank"
      >article</a

    where Jerry Seinfeld says his secret to productivity is to get something
    done every day, because if you skip one day then skipping another day is
    easier.

    The majority of those days I would like to think I did real commits. I
    pledged to myself to do more than just white space tweaks or write a script
    to do the work for me. I wanted to accomplish things and make a difference.
    I started projects, wrote code, cleaned up old code, added tests, documented
    a lot, and moved my blog here. It's been an awesome time, and keeping my
    fingers constantly in projects has been eye opening.

    I've really enjoyed this but there were days it was hard to get to the
    internet or days I was busy on other things. I discovered early on my phone
    was not a good interface with Github's text editor. Some days I had no
    desire to code or lacked the creativity to write. Then I remembered that my
    ability to work openly on Github is a gift, and I should just do it. Now I
    can relax a bit and if I miss a day, it's not such a big deal. I've made it
    to the Longest Streak list!

    We'll see what happens now. I just feel happy that I've captured the moment
    and made my mark on the board. I invite you to do the same.
