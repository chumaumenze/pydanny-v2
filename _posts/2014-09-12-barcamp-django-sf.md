    On October 4th and 5th
    <a href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"
      >BarCamp Django SF</a
    >
    will be taking place in the
    <a href="http://eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> office in San
    Francisco.
    <a href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"
      >BarCamp Django SF</a
    >
    is a low-cost, community-focused event that's different than any previous
    multi-day
    <a href="http://djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a> conference.
  </p>
  <p>
    How is
    <a href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"
      >BarCamp Django SF</a
    >
    different than previous Django conferences and events?
  </p>
  <h2 id="speakers-are-determined-at-the-event">
    Speakers are determined at the event

  <p>
    I know what you are thinking. It's something on the line of "<em
      >What the heck?!?</em
    >"
  </p>
  <p>
    It means that if you want to give a talk, you don't need to be an expert. We
    don't have an formal, extensive review process. It's a chance to share ideas
    and learn something new. You can be just a Django hobbyist instead of a
    professional. All you have to be is <strong>passionate</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the event, we'll put up a board with slots for talks. Attendees can put
    themselves into these slots for talks. This makes for a fun, fluid event
    where new speakers are as welcome as experienced speakers.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this is meant to be an informal, beginner-friendly event, a
    professional level of conduct is still required:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Speakers, like all attendees must agree to the
      <a
        href="https://eb-blog-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Eventbrite-Code-of-Conduct.pdf"
        target="_blank"
        >code of conduct</a
      >
      (also listed on the
      <a href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"
        >event page</a
      >).
    </li>
    <li>No sales or recruiting pitches. Don't even try it!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>note:</strong> Since enough people asked me about it,
    <strong>speaking is not mandatory</strong> for attendees of BarCamp Django
    SF.
  </p>
  <h2 id="barcamp-django-are-just-15">BarCamp Django are just $15</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you read that correctly, tickets for this event are just
    <strong>$15</strong>. All proceeds from ticket sales are going to the Django
    Software Foundation.
  </p>
  <p>What that <strong>$15</strong> gets you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Meals and snacks.</li>
    <li>
      A chance to share ideas, learn something new, and network with peers.
    </li>
    <li>
      A big speaking room and over 10 smaller rooms for breakout sessions.
    </li>
    <li>Security, including enforcement of the code of conduct.</li>
    <li>Camping! (see below)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="camping">Camping!</h2>
  <p>
    On the night of October 4th, you can stay overnight at
    <a href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"
      >BarCamp Django SF</a
    >!
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"
      >BarCamp Django SF</a
    >
    is 2 days, and will run from 10am Saturday morning until 4pm Sunday in the
    <a href="http://eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> San Francisco
    office. Doors will be open throughout the duration of the event and all are
    welcome to camp out overnight. If you do plan on camping, you'll need to
    <strong
      >bring your own sleeping bag, blow up beds, pillows &amp; blankets</strong
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    What's really awesome about camping at
    <a href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"
      >BarCamp Django SF</a
    >
    is it allows out-of-town attendees to keep their costs low ($15 event cost
    vs $200+ hotel rooms).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>note:</strong> Our definition of 'camping' is staying overnight
    inside the Eventbrite office in San Francisco. While you can't pitch a tent,
    you don't have to worry about mosquitoes. Some people will stay up all
    night, but we'll have quiet areas for those of us who need our 8 hours.
