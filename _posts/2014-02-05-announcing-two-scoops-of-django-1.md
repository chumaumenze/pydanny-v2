    Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.6 is chock-full of even
    more material that will help you with your Django projects. We'll introduce
    you to various tips, tricks, patterns, code snippets, and techniques that
    we've picked up over the years. We have put thousands of hours into writing
    and revising its hundreds of pages of concise, example-packed text.

    Why Should You Purchase the Second Edition?

      "I read the first edition cover to cover. The second one raises the bar
      again. It's pedagogical, entertaining, and thoughtful."

    Why should you buy this updated version of our previous book? Well, it's
    more than a slight rename, it's been

      >expanded</a
    >!
  </p>
  <h1 id="its-revised">It's Revised</h1>
  <p>
    Significant portions of the previous material have been revised,
    incorporating huge amounts of feedback submitted by our readers over the
    past year. We listened to suggestions, clarified existing content, and
    incorporated useful tips into the book, carefully curating what went in and
    what didn't. Our goal was to make the existing content even more succinct
    and worth reading.

      reasons developing on SQLite causes problems."

    As with writing the previous edition, we asked numerous subject matter
    experts on security, databases, deployment and more for their feedback and
    advice. We're not afraid to ask questions or to ask the best and brightest
    to find fault with our work. It's hard to be told you're wrong by those who
    you respect, and even harder to change patterns you promoted. However, we
    believe it's our duty to the readers to make our book the best is can be.

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We had countless requests for more content from readers around the world.
    People asked us to cover more and more stuff and we've done our best to
    comply. We have new material on function-based views, Django 1.6-era
    transactions, deployment, internationalization, Python 3, identical
    environments, and more.

  </p>
  <p>
    This isn't to say that we padded the book. Not at all. The new material is
    packed with our loud volume of code examples and concise explanations. We
    would like to think it's awesome, but that's because we had the whole world
    helping us put it together.
  </p>
  <h1 id="we-did-it-together">We Did It Together</h1>
  <p>
    I believe this new edition is amazing. As I said before, we didn't do it
    alone, we had you in our corner. By you, I mean the technical reviewers and
    readers giving us support and feedback. We did it for you, the Python and
    Django developers around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Which means I'm delighted that our latest effort is finally in print. In my
    perfect world it gets a thousand five star reviews. ;-)
