    Since I was a child I wanted to be a published author. I've dreamt of people
    reading my book. While one could say that dream was fulfilled when we
    launched the e-book version in January, it's not the same as seeing the
    printed copy. Today I got to see my dream come true, a printed
    <a

    >
    is out there with my name on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, I have a confession to make. When it comes to technical books, I
    really prefer the print version. For me, nothing beats being able to flip
    through pages of a hardcopy next to a keyboard, or simply reading while I'm
    on a bus, train, or plane. So this adds to my excitement when I get to say
    that the book that
    <a href="http://audreymroy.com/" target="_blank">Audrey Roy</a> and I wrote
    together is in
    <a

      >print</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: As of April 17th it's only available in the US. However, it's in the
    queue for being available for Amazon Europe. Enough people are asking that
    we are also looking into getting it bulk shipped to
    <a href="http://djangocircus.com/" target="_blank">Django Circus</a>.

    While it's been an amazing journey, it's also been a long hard road.
    Starting with a late night dinner with
    <a href="http://rdegges.com" target="_blank">Randall Degges</a>, his wife
    <a href="http://hardlyfunny.com" target="_blank">Samantha</a>, and
    <a href="https://bravoflix.com/" target="_blank">Sean Bradley</a>, to
    spending hours upon hours writing and revising, to taking painfully honest
    critiques from mentors, to alpha launch, then rewriting the book followed by
    the beta launch. It wasn't easy, but the growing volume of positive feedback
    and suggestions from readers kept us going.
  </p>
  <p>
    Between the Alpha and Beta releases we switched over to LaTeX. Audrey taught
    it to me in February, and I'm proud to say I've progressed from absolute
    neophyte to beginner. We chose it because of it's fine-grained control over
    layout for the PDF and print versions. Creating the Kindle and ePub versions
    from LaTeX was harder thanks to using LaTeX, but everything's automated now
    so making updates is easy. Future editions of this

    >
    (1.6, 1.7, etc) or other technical books I hope to write will continue to be
    in LaTeX, but if I publish fiction I'll probably go with RestructuredText.

    While working on the final version we were greatly saddened by the death of
    Malcolm Tredennick, to whom the
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366166104&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=ihpydanny-20"

    is dedicated. We miss him terribly. I've tried to write about Malcolm's
    volume of his contribution to the
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366166104&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=ihpydanny-20"
      target="_blank"
      >book</a
    >, but it's still too hard. For now, let's just say that he gave and taught
    us so much and asked us for nothing in return, which is why we continue to
    give free copies of the PDF edition of the
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/Two-Scoops-Django-Best-Practices/dp/1481879707/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366166104&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=ihpydanny-20"

    to developers in need, as well as try to stay in contact with all recipients
    of the free PDF.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, if you are a developer in need, and can't afford a copy, drop us a
    note at
    <a href="mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com" target="_blank"
      >2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a
    >
    explaining your situation. Our quick rule of thumb is that if you can afford
    to buy games for your favorite device, then you can afford to buy our

      target="_blank"
      >book</a
    >. Also, please do your friends a favor and don't just give them a copy
    without having them ask us. Why not? Well,
    <strong

    even now that the final edition is out.

  <p>
    What now? Well, we aren't certain. We're maintaining a couple client
    projects but aren't taking on new ones. We've got a couple projects we're
    working on and I'm talking employment with a couple companies who do good
    things for the community.
