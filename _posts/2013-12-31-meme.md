    What's the Coolest Thing You Discovered This Year?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Alex had his own focused on Python applications, frameworks, and libraries.
    Me, I'm going for a more general approach. This year I discovered:
  </p>
  <h2 id="latex">LaTeX</h2>
  <p>
    That <a href="django.2scoops.org" target="_blank">book</a> I co-wrote with
    <a href="http://audreyr.com" target="_blank">Audrey Roy</a>? Written in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>. It
    wasn't easy to get started, even with Audrey as my instructor, but now that
    I grok it, I feel extremely empowered. That's because I can do all kinds of
    awesome, insane hacks when
    <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/" target="_blank">Sphinx</a> generates PDFs.
    I hope I get the chance to show off some of my new madness to the world in
    2014.

  <h2 id="how-to-tie-a-bow-tie">How to Tie A Bow Tie</h2>
  <p>
    If you are going to be formal, the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_tie" target="_blank">bow tie</a>
    adds an enormous amount of class. However, clip-ons are considered tacky,
    especially as it's considered stylish to loosen the bow tie later in the
    evening to demonstrate you aren't wearing that clip.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of all the stuff I watched on the subject of bow tying,
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5PTLV-L_sk" target="_blank"
      >this video</a
    >
    was the longest and the best of them all.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Update 1/4/2014:</strong> I learned this awesome skill because

  <h2 id="awesome-foods-around-the-world">Awesome Foods Around the World</h2>
  <p>Here's the short-list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscypek" target="_blank"
        >Oscypek</a
      >
      is a Polish smoked, salted cheese that should be exported to the universe.
      Seriously. If you get some, grill it and serve with jelly.
    </li>
    <li>
      In Florence, Italy you can eat Duck Carpaccio and it is heavenly. If there
      is ever a reason to visit Florence, it is Duck Carpaccio.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Croatian King Truffle Bar is an ice cream delicacy you can find in any
      street market freezer. It's multiple shells of chocolate and ice cream in
      an ice cream bar that speaks taste bud breaking volumes to at least the
      American palate.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the Philippines, they combine shaved ice, evaporated milk, purple yam
      ice cream, and tropical fruits into something they call
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo-halo" target="_blank"
        >Halo-Halo</a
      >. It's indescribably yummy and the Los Angeles-based Jollibee version
      Anthony Bourdain tried on his show is a pale comparison to the fantastic
      treat I've been lucky enough to devour in Manila.
    </li>
  </ul>

    What New Programming Technique Did You Learn This Year?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Hard to say, but I'll go with Python's context managers. Trying to find a
    way to have what I learned see the light of day. Love the clients, but this
    is a good reason to try and do more open source work.

    Which Open Source Project Did You Contribute to the Most This Year? What Did
    You Do?
  </h1>
  <p>
    While I contributed nothing directly to the framework itself, between our
    book and numerous open source projects, I guess the answer is 'Django'.
  </p>
  <p>In 2014 I want to switch that focus to Python.</p>
  <h1 id="what-are-the-top-three-things-you-want-to-learn-next-year">
    What Are the Top Three Things You Want to Learn Next Year?
  </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>The new async framework added in Python 3.4.</li>
    <li>C because I think it will enhance my Python skills.</li>
    <li>
      How to be a better person. I think I educated and helped a lot of people
      this year, but I can do better.
      <strong>Malcolm Tredennick</strong> quietly led the way, and with all the
      help he provided to Audrey and I in January for our book, we owe it to his
      memory to improve the lot of developers everywhere.

    Something that gets more women into the top 10 of
    <a href="https://www.gittip.com/" target="_blank">Gittip</a>. That amazing
    women developers and community leaders in the Python community like
    <a href="https://www.gittip.com/roguelynn/" target="_blank">Lynn Root</a>,
    <a href="https://www.gittip.com/jessicamckellar/" target="_blank"
      >Jessica McKellar</a
    >, dare I say
    <a href="https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/" target="_blank">Audrey</a>
    <a href="https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/" target="_blank">Roy</a>, and
    others aren't up there speaks uncomfortable volumes. Starting today, I'm
    directing all my Gittip funds in their direction. Well... not Audrey because
    she won't let me, but you get the idea.

  <p>
    This year, 2013, was a wonderful year. Everything changed. I hope to have a
    summary out today because some fantastically incredible things occurred. If
    not, then it will happen next year... err... tomorrow! ;-)
