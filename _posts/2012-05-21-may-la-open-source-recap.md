    On May 12th, 2012, over 50

      >JavaScript</a
    >, and <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> developers
    arrived to code on a variety of projects. It was awesome! Tons of open
    source projects saw contributions, and people across languages and
    frameworks worked together.

    Less then two weeks before May 12, a bunch of us Los Angeles area Python
    developers were hanging out and wishing we had a local sprint to attend that
    was just about developers working on open source projects. It was then that
    <a href="http://audreymroy.com" target="_blank">Audrey Roy</a> and I, along
    with an army of hardworking volunteers, decided to stop wishing and make it
    happen on May 12th.
  </p>
  <p>
    We lined up a venue, contacted awesome sponsors
    <a href="http://spire.io" target="_blank">Spire.io</a>,
    <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>,
    <a href="http://cars.com" target="_blank">Cars.com</a>, and
    <a href="https://academy.cartwheelweb.com" target="_blank"
      >Cartwheel Academy</a
    >. As we did that, we also invited people from the many Los Angeles
    programming communities in Los Angeles to join us. The result of everyone's
    hard work?
    <strong>We filled up all sixty spots in less than 96 hours!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Some of the projects worked on included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Salt Stack:
      <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt" target="_blank"
        >https://github.com/saltstack/salt</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      A node.js-powered streaming terminal, allowing for shared input at a
      terminal among several participants.
    </li>
    <li>A JavaScript powered astrolabe.</li>
    <li>Settlers of Catan analytics in JavaScript.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/" target="_blank">OpenFrameworks</a
      >, a cross-platform toolkit for creative coding in C++.
    </li>
    <li>
      My own time at the sprint was spent with Audrey Roy and
      <a href="http://rdegges.com" target="_blank">Randall Degges</a> on
      engineering cleanup and fixing bugs on
      <a href="https://github.com/opencomparison/opencomparison" target="_blank"
        >OpenComparison</a
      >.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There's going to be another Los Angeles open source event on July 15 at
    <a href="http://originate.com/" target="_blank">Originate</a>. Instead of
    less then two weeks to plan, we have nearly two months - so it's going to be
    better!
