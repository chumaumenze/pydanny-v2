  <p>
    You should go to
    <a href="http://djangocon.eu" target="_blank">DjangoCon Europe</a> in lovely
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich" target="_blank">Zurich</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" target="_blank"
      >Switzerland</a
    >. Here are 10 reasons why:
  </p>
  <h1 id="1-chocolate">1. <strong>Chocolate</strong></h1>
  <p>
    So much of what we like about chocolate comes from Switzerland. For example,
    Milk Chocolate was invented in Switzerland.
  </p>
  <h1 id="2-keynote-speaker-jacob-kaplan-moss">
    2. <strong>Keynote speaker: Jacob Kaplan-Moss</strong>
  </h1>
  <p>
    Always a great speaker and fun to be around, he's one of the BDFL's of
    <a href="http://djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a>.
  </p>
  <h1 id="3-cheese">3. <strong>Cheese</strong></h1>
  <p>
    I grew up thinking that Swiss Cheese was just about holes. It's so much
    more. I can't wait to try fresh European cheese made by master craftsmen
    from the freshest ingredients.
  </p>
  <h1 id="4-keynote-speaker-jessica-mckellar">
    4. <strong>Keynote speaker: Jessica McKellar</strong>
  </h1>
  <p>
    In a word, Jessica is <strong>incredible</strong>. She's a Twisted core
    developer, PSF board member, part of the trio responsible for the gigantic
    Boston Python User Group's massive size explosion, and a talented speaker.
    She's used her incredible talents and skills to increase diversity in the
    community and generally help other people.
  </p>
  <h1 id="5-breakfast">5. <strong>Breakfast</strong></h1>
  <p>
    Muesli was invented in Switzerland. I love Muesli. I was floored by how much
    better it was in New Zealand. I can't wait to try it in it's homeland.
  </p>
  <h1 id="6-web-site">6. <strong>Web Site</strong></h1>
  <p>
    The DjangoCon Europe site is crazy. I mean, look at all those animations!
  </p>
  <h1 id="7-talks">7. <strong>Talks</strong></h1>
  <p>
    This is a single track event with proven speakers like Zachary Voase and
    Andrew Godwin, yet balances that with bringing in new blood to spice things
    up. And dare I say
    <a
      href="http://2012.djangocon.eu/schedule/round-pegs-and-square-holes/"
      target="_blank"
      >I'm giving a technical talk</a
    >
    with <a href="http://audreymroy.com/" target="_blank">Audrey Roy</a>? ;-)
  </p>
  <h1 id="8-mountains">8. <strong>Mountains</strong></h1>
  <p>
    With all the incredible food, you would think you would gain umpteen
    kilograms. Fortunately there are mountains all around to climb and hike.
  </p>
  <h1 id="9-sprints">9. <strong>Sprints</strong></h1>
  <p>
    Want to sprint on Django itself? Look no further because there will be
    Django core developers around! There will also be notable
    <a href="http://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> developers like
    <a href="http://kennethreitz.com/" target="_blank">Kenneth Reitz</a> and
    others around working hard on a lot of different projects. It's going to
    intense and fun!
  </p>
  <h1 id="10-castles">10. <strong>Castles</strong></h1>
  <p>
    Living in the USA, we just don't have anything like castles. DjangoCon
    Europe will be near a
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_castles_and_fortresses_in_Switzerland#Zurich"
      target="_blank"
      >small horde of stone fortifications</a
    >. Which means if the Zombie Apocalypse happens during the conference, we'll
    have many secure places to go. They also make lovely tourist destinations.
    :-)
  </p>
  <h1 id="what-are-you-waiting-for">What are you waiting for?</h1>
  <p>
    DjangoCon Europe has a cap on attendance. Tickets for Python events have
    been selling out, not just for PyCon US. Don't miss out!
  </p>
  <h1 id="its-all-about-me">It's all about me</h1>
  <p>Yup.</p>
  <p>
    Call me selfish but I want you there because I haven't haven't met all our
    European friends yet in person. Hope to see you next month in Zurich!
