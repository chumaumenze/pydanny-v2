  <p>
    New to Python and/or conferences and attending the upcoming
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/" target="_blank">PyCon 2015</a> in
    Montreal, Canada? Or is this your first conference? Or perhaps your first
    conference longer than a weekend?
  </p>
  <p>Hoping to get the most out of joining thousands of Python enthusiasts?</p>
  <p>
    No worries! This guide will aid you in attending one of the best technical
    conferences on the planet. Even though I'm not attending on account of
    various reasons including finances, work, and personal projects, I'm going
    to share how to get through duration of pycon in good shape. I'm also going
    to share some great tricks to optimize the event.
  </p>
  <h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Take at least one shower per day. Please.</li>
    <li>
      Bring something to take notes. A paper notebook, laptop, or tablet.
      Anything!
    </li>
    <li>If you are looking for work, bring business cards. Seriously.</li>
    <li>
      At every meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) make a point of sitting with or
      going out with different people. Introduce yourself. Make new friends and
      learn new things!
    </li>
    <li>
      If you can't make it to a talk, don't stress out. They are recorded and
      will be available later on
      <a href="http://www.pyvideo.org" target="_blank">http://www.pyvideo.org</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>Act Professionally (see next section)</li>
  </ol>
  <h1 id="be-professional">Be Professional</h1>
  <p>
    PyCon is a professional event. Sure, lots of people are in t-shirts and are
    having fun, often in oddly goofy ways. Yet stepping outside the boundaries
    of civilized behavior is not acceptable. Keep in mind that PyCon US has a
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/about/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank"
      >code of conduct</a
    >. Whether or not you agree with codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US
    has one and it will be enforced.
  </p>
  <h1 id="get-to-the-registration-desk-early">
    Get to the Registration Desk Early
  </h1>
  <p>
    As the lines for registration can get epic, I like to get my badge as early
    as possible so I don't miss PyCon's famously incredible keynote speeches.
  </p>
  <h1 id="must-see-tutorials">Must-See Tutorials</h1>
  <p>
    All of the beginner tutorials at
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/tutorials/" target="_blank"
      >https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/tutorials/</a
    >
    look wonderful. You simply can't go wrong with any of them.
  </p>
  <h1 id="must-see-talks">Must-See Talks</h1>
  <p>All of them.</p>
  <p>
    I'm actually a little relieved that I'm not going to PyCon, because there
    were some time slots thad several must-see talks running concurrently. I
    would have to clone myself repeatedly in order to see all the good stuff!
    Fortunately, I'll be able to watch them on
    <a href="http://www.pyvideo.org" target="_blank">http://www.pyvideo.org</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are new to open source and plan to attend the PyCon 2015 sprints (or
    in general contribute to open source), then I strongly recommend Shauna
    Gordon-McKeon's "Open Source for Newcomers and the People Who Want to
    Welcome Them" talk (description at
    <a
      href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/"
      target="_blank"
      >https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/</a
    >). She's the program director of Open Hatch, a group focused on bringing
    more people into the open source community.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pro-tip</strong>: For the talks you are excited about attending, get
    there early. If you really want to attend a particular talk, odds are so
    does everyone else and the room might be packed. Don't be forced to sit on
    the floor or stand outside the door. Show up early!
  </p>
  <p>
    See
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/" target="_blank"
      >https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/</a
    >
    for the talk schedules.
  </p>
  <h1 id="talk-attendance-guidelines">Talk Attendance Guidelines</h1>
  <p>
    At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and
    brightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some quick
    guidelines:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ask Questions!</strong> If the speaker leaves time for questions
      at the end,
      <a
        href="http://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/"
        target="_blank"
        >go and ask</a
      >!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.</strong> It's
      disconcerting to give a speech to hundreds of people staring at their
      portable electronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are
      using electronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning
      them off to look at the speaker.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Don't Heckle.</strong> It's nerve wracking going up in front of
      hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video. Heckling
      is <strong>never</strong> funny and it's a good way to lose friends and
      make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the talk, wait
      until the end and then ask your questions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h1 id="lunches">Lunches</h1>
  <p>
    Don't forget to keep whatever they hand out to track meals at the
    registration desk or you might not be able to get your food.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try and sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every time
    I do this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get to meet amazing
    people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and you'll never get to know any of
    them unless you try.
  </p>
  <h1 id="sprints">Sprints</h1>
  <p>
    When the tutorials and talks are over, the sprints begin. These are like
    hackathons, but for only open source efforts. Imagine the chance to apply
    everything you just learn, while sitting amongst other Python enthusiast
    including dozens of projects leaders. Not only do you get the chance to
    apply what you've just learned, you can contribute to make the world of
    Python better!
  </p>
  <p>
    See
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/" target="_blank"
      >https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/</a
    >
    for general sprint information.
  </p>
  <h2 id="sprint-requirements">Sprint Requirements</h2>
  <p>
    For beginners setting up a Python development environment can be tricky. If
    the list below looks intimidating, look for any sprints with "beginner" in
    the title. There is always something! While they aren't listed yet, but
    there should be something up within a week or two.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, if you want a pre-PyCon challenge, I recommend getting
    the the following installed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Modern versions of Python:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Python 2.7 (mandatory)</li>
          <li>Python 3.4 (Rather mandatory for Python 3 work)</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Be ready with source control. You should have installed and possess
        working knowledge with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Git. Really make sure you have a GitHub account</li>
          <li>Mercurial. Useful to have a BitBucket account.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank"
          >virtualenv</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html"
          target="_blank"
          >pip</a
        >
        for all versions of Python. If you are using Python 3.4, you don't need
        to have them installed.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>An IDE or Text Editor you are comfortable using.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 id="staying-healthy-over-nine-days-of-python">
    Staying Healthy Over Nine Days of Python!
  </h1>
  <p>
    If you attend the tutorials, talks and sprints, that's
    <strong>nine days</strong>. You (or your organization) are putting out some
    serious money for you to go and discover new knowledge, new people, or a
    bunch of other reasons. The last thing you want to do is end up sick for
    part or all of the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Odds are you'll be riding in public transit (planes, trains, buses) to get
    there. Unfortunately, you'll be travelling with people who are sick. Then,
    for over a week, you'll be around thousands of people who have travelled
    under similar conditions. Many of those people, possibly yourself, will be
    eating poorly, drinking heavily, and not getting enough sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some things I've found work wonders to keep me active and alert and
    I recommend you do the same <strong>every</strong> day of the conference:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Take at least one shower per day. Please.</li>
    <li>
      Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different people
      at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!
    </li>
    <li>
      Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your brain is
      going to go into learning overdrive. I aim for 6-8 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring
      <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/Airborne-Support-Supplement-Vitamin-Effervescent/dp/B000WZI4WY?tag=mlinar-20"
        target="_blank"
        >Immune System Boosters</a
      >
      and consume them daily. I usually do it with breakfast and lunch.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1 id="get-autographs">Get Autographs!</h1>
  <p>
    As an author, I can't recommend enough that you bring your favorite
    programming book and get it autographed. A few books I want to get signed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
