  <p>
    I'm an open source developer. I use Python, Django, PostgreSQL, JQuery,
    MongoDB, Memcached, and Redis. I push production code to Linux servers.
  </p>
  <p>And yet:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My laptop runs Apple's Mac OS X.</li>
    <li>My primary editor is Sublime Text.</li>
    <li>My production servers are provided mostly by Heroku.</li>
    <li>All my sites are hosted on Amazon EC2.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I've got nothing against Apple, Heroku, or Amazon, but their tools are not
    open source.
  </p>
  <p>And that's food for thought.</p>
  </div>
