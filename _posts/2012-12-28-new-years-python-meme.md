  <p>
    Tarek Ziade has a habit of ending the year with a Python-themed meme. I've
    matched his meme the times he previousstarted it, and as you can tell from
    the title of this blog post I'm matching him yet again.

    1. What's the coolest Python application, framework or library you have
    discovered in 2012?
  </h1>
  <p>
    This question took some thought. It was a toss-up between these three
    choices:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Django Class Based Views (CBVs) allow developers do amazing things with
      Django, but needed some polish (<a
        href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/"
        target="_blank"
        >improved documentation</a
      >,
      <a href="http://django-braces.readthedocs.org/" target="_blank"
        >missing functionality</a
      >) to be able to shine.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://reportlab.org" target="_blank">ReportLab</a> for
      generating PDF allowed me to create some
      <a href="http://www.petcheatsheets.com/" target="_blank"
        >impressive results</a
      >, but the API needed updating. The other Python PDF libraries might be
      better, but getting images to work trivially in them
    </li>
    <li>
      If I didn't completely agree with
      <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/12/29/sql-is-agile/" target="_blank"
        >Armin Ronacher on the subject</a
      >, I might have gone with a combination of
      <a href="http://api.mongodb.org/python/" target="_blank">PyMongo</a>,
      <a href="http://mongoengine.org/" target="_blank">MongoEngine</a>, and
      <a href="http://namlook.github.com/mongokit/" target="_blank">MongoKit</a
      >. Just like Armin, I've learned through working with schemaless databases
      to know that schemas are awesome.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The winner?</p>

    <p><strong>Django Class Based Views</strong></p>

    In 2012 what I managed to accomplish with Django CBVs was incredible. From
    early self-instructional work I did for

    or helped get into Django core, it made for a great year. Also I wasn't just
    productive personally, I helped increased the productivity of others around
    the world.

    2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012?
  </h1>
  <p>I thought I understood multiple inheritance.</p>
  <p>I really did.</p>
  <p>
    However, since the start of this year I've delved really deep into it, only
    to discover just how much I didn't know. While that didn't do my ego any
    favors, it was a nice refreshing reminder not to get arrogant about one's
    skills.

    3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What
    did you do?
  </h1>
  <p>The answer to this is <strong>Django</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    After using Django professionally for 2.5 years, I finally began
    contributing to the core framework at the DjangoCon Eu 2012 sprints. I
    joined a group of other dedicated people who decided to improve the
    <a
      href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/"
      target="_blank"
      >Django CBV documentation</a
    >, our goal being setting a new standard for documentation. I'm not sure if
    we set a new bar in documentation, but we did improve on the existing
    material.
  </p>
  <p>
    I branched out into some other areas of core Django development with mixed
    results, which played out that way because I just didn't have the time to do
    more.

  <p>I've got a couple:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A Python SDK that produces results that work perfectly for both modern iOS
      and Android. Think Corona SDK but with Python.
    </li>
    <li>A modern PyGame release that installs trivially on Mac OS X.</li>
