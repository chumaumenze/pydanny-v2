    We (me and Audrey) are going to be giving a keynote speech at
    <a href="https://www.pycon.co/" target="_blank">PyCon Colombia</a> on
    February 11th! Hooray!

    We'll be arriving in Medellin late evening on February 7th and staying a
    while longer after the conference so we can have the time to explore the
    lovely city of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn" target="_blank"
      >Medellin</a
    >. We're very excited, because travel is a rarity for us now and Medellin
    (and the surrounding area) is supposed to be quite beautiful. Plus, all the
    Colombians we know online are excellent people - we can't wait to meet them!
  </p>
  <p>
    Our hope is that on the day(s) after
    <a href="https://www.pycon.co/" target="_blank">PyCon Colombia</a> we can
    see the sights and eat the foods with Colombians who know Medellin. So let
    me know if you want to meet up!
  </p>
  <p>Hasta pronto!</p>
