</div>
</h1>
<p>This year in June, the European edition of
<a href="http://djangocon.eu" target="_blank">DjangoCon</a> is going to be held in lovely
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich" target="_blank">Zurich</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" target="_blank">Switzerland</a>. It is my great
fortune and delight to announce that <a href="http://audreymroy.com" target="_blank">Audrey</a> and
I will be attending. Hooray!</p>
<p>Needless to say, we're extremely excited. My <a href="http://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/search/label/ploneconf2007" target="_blank">trip to Europe in
2007</a> was
an amazingly fun and educational experience, and I can't wait to share
a similar experience with Audrey. We can't wait to see all our old
European friends, make new ones, and be dazzled by what Europe has to
offer.</p>
<p>Also, let's face it, the conference is going to be <strong>incredible</strong>.
They've lined up some awesome venues, the food
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette" target="_blank">cheese</a>, chocolate,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli" target="_blank">muesli</a>, etc) in Switzerland is
world-renowned, the website looks fantastic, and they've got Jacob
Kaplan-Moss to keynote. It looks so good I'm surprised there are any
<a href="http://2012.djangocon.eu/sponsors/" target="_blank">sponsor slots left</a>!</p>
<h1 id="talks">Talks</h1>
<p>While attending the conference, we submitted and hope to give a
presentation on the positives (speed, flexibility, community, etc) and
negatives (a few) of using <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> as a
<a href="http://djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a> datastore. I'm also considering
giving a second talk. Some ideas for that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zen of Django</li>
<li>Django isn't for beginners (A Tredennick inspired talk explaining
why teaching beginning developers Django isn't a good idea)</li>
<li>Advanced Django Template Usage</li>
<li>Advanced Django Models Usage (An intimidating talk to put together)</li>
<li>Django Packages Thunderdome II</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>While I'm at it, I'm going to poke any prospective conference goers to
submit their own talks. I love attending conference talks and at PyCon
US this year I barely got to see any. Show me what you got!</p>
