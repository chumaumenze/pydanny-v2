    We (<a href="http://audreymroy.com" target="_blank">Audrey Roy</a> and I)
    wrote a <a href="http://django.2scoops.org" target="_blank">book</a> on
    Django! It's called
    <strong>Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</strong>, and
    you can buy it right now in e-book (PDF) form on the website:
    <a href="http://django.2scoops.org" target="_blank"
      >http://django.2scoops.org</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Django, like any framework, has tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't
    documented in one place. Experienced developers know this stuff, but
    gleaning it off the Internet takes a lot of time. We decided to take
    everything we know and write it down. This
    <a href="http://django.2scoops.org" target="_blank">book</a> reflects a
    portion of what we documented, and if it does well we plan to follow it up
    with other references.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've followed this blog or watched our talks you've know we've
    explained tons of Django and Python related examples. We enjoy using Django
    and Python to build stable, fast web applications quickly and efficiently.
    This is the <a href="http://django.2scoops.org" target="_blank">book</a> we
    would have wanted while learning the intricacies of our tools, and then kept
    it handy for reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <a href="http://django.2scoops.org" target="_blank">book</a> we cover
    everything from customizing the Django 1.5 User model, forms, views,
    templates, security, bottleneck analysis and so much more. We tie in
    third-party packages from the Django and Python community. We discuss the
    positive patterns that allow for rapid development, and point out the
    anti-patterns that cause problems. The result isn't a walk-through or
    tutorial, but a reference guide for anyone with at least a basic
    understanding of Django.
  </p>
  <p>
    We tried to make the code copy/pastable, but we are constrained by the
    limits of PDF. While the code examples display nicely,
    <em>when pasting from Adobe Reader the leading white spaces vanish</em>. We
    apologize and ask if anyone knows how to address this issue to let us know
    at
    <a href="mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com" target="_blank"
      >2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even with an amazing cadre of technical reviewers, there is always the
    possibility of errors. We are going to be actively maintaining the
    <a href="http://django.2scoops.org" target="_blank">book</a>, so if you find
    a mistake, let us know and we'll update it and send out an updated copy of
    the PDF to all buyers.
