      >Coldest Spring (3rd in the Ambria series)</a
    >, is out AND it's my birthday. In honor of of these occasions, the first
    book of the series, Darkest Autumn, for 0.99 cents on Amazon. Plus, I'm
    doing a Python-related giveaway.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The Giveaway:</strong> There's a python programming easter egg in
    the book. One of the characters mentions the elegance of Python. The first
    person who tells me in the comments below the name of the father and
    grandfather of that character gets an autographed

    shipping anywhere in the world.

    Finally, if you want to give me a truly special present for my birthday,
    please review any or all of my books on Amazon. Positive or negative, every
    review makes a difference. The positive stuff feeds my already inflated ego,
    and the negative stuff tells me what I need to do in order to improve.

      July 24th 3pm: A commenter by the name of
      <strong>@lingot</strong> answered first and they'll get the autographed
      book. However, there is an even more precise response than the one they
      gave. If anyone can provide that answer, they get an autographed TSD 1.11
      as well. Good luck!
