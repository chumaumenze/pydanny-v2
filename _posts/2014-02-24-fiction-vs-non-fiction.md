  <p>I'm a published author.</p>

    There, I said it. I co-wrote a

  </p>
  <p>Well, not completely.</p>
  <p>
    Truth is, I've always wanted to be a fiction author. Don't get me wrong,
    writing a technical book has been a life-worthy experience, with
    unbelievable challenges, incredible highs, and soul-crushing lows. I'm
    delighted we made it happen, and want to write more technical works. Still,
    there are things about writing fiction that have become very appealing to
    me.
  </p>
  <h1 id="justification">Justification</h1>
  <p>
    When you write a technical book, everything has to be justified. I'm not
    talking about ensuring proper <em>layout justification</em>, I'm talking
    about the concept of <em>content justification</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When writing a technical book, everything is questioned. That's a good
    thing, because developers should be a little cynical, questioning
    everything. Making certain your writing can stand up to this kind of
    scrutiny is a huge amount of work. It's not even whether or not readers want
    to believe you, as technical writing leads itself to readers purposefully or
    incidentally doing real-world tests of your content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, making your work a best practices guide means that your effort
    really, really, REALLY comes under scrutiny. ;-)
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, with fiction, while it's good to have justifiable work, the
    critical need for it is normally not there. You just write, and so long as
    the reader <strong>feels</strong> that the body of work is believable, you
    are okay.
  </p>
  <h1 id="you-cant-write-tests-for-prose">You Can't Write Tests for Prose</h1>
  <p>
    Two Scoops of Django has tests. Technical articles I write on this blog now
    have tests. This is because writing tests up front is a lot more fun than
    writing, "Whoops! I'll fix that!"
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, when writing prose, there are no tests. Every reader will
    interpret your work differently. Even if they interpret your work on similar
    lines, it's still a personal experience. If I like or dislike something I
    read, the way I like or dislike it will differ from any other reader.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, I'm quite aware of how different people have interpreted the prose
    of this blog or Two Scoops of Django. I'm actually quite fascinated how
    different people experience my prose, sometimes misinterpreting what I
    write, getting beneficial or malignant things out of it that I never
    imagined.
  </p>
  <p>You can't write tests for this, it just happens.</p>
  <h1 id="not-everything-has-to-be-described">
    Not Everything Has to Be Described
  </h1>
  <p>
    When you are writing a technical book, you have to describe all elements
    mentioned. Not being a tutorial, Two Scoops of Django allowed us to truncate
    a tiny, small amount of things. As any technical author knows, this
    represents a huge amount of work.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fiction, you create characters, scenes, and stories in such a way that
    the reader paints it in their mind's eye. If done right, the reader feels
    that you've written in an evocative fashion. If done wrong, the reader is
    bored and uninspired.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to do write evocatively, one technique used is not describing
    everything. Authors leave blank spaces. It's these blank spaces that allow
    the readers to create their own vista of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> I'm well aware that writing isn't the only medium
    that uses blank spaces. Painting, sculpture, film making, music, and every
    form of art finds a way to use this technique.
  </p>
  <h1 id="eternal-dynamic-characters">Eternal Dynamic Characters</h1>
  <p>
    A dynamic character is either a good person who can be bad, or a bad person
    who can be good. Using this definition of character in technical books is
    challenging and is usually reserved to rants about some necessary but
    unpleasant component. Of course, that rant often becomes dated, as someone
    who is also annoyed by the same component creates something that replaces
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, in fiction dynamic characters survive as long as they are
    in print. We can read again and again stories about heroes and anti-heroes,
    and recommend them to our associates.
  </p>
  <p>This is a permanence I long to have in my writing.</p>
  <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
  <p>For these reasons and many more, fiction wins.</p>
  <p>
    I'm writing! It's challenging but engaging. I won't speak much about what
    I'm writing, except to say it falls in the 'fantasy and science fiction'
    genre.
