    I'm often asked by new programmers how they can forge a path into using
    their skills professionally. Or how they can get better at writing software.
  </p>
  <h1 id="how-to-improve-your-coding-skills">
    How to Improve Your Coding Skills
  </h1>
  <p>
    This was my path. It may not be your path. This path also isn't in any
    particular order, all of them apply from the moment you start on the path.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I coded. A lot. From silly little scripts to automating tasks to
      attempting full-blown projects. At work or for fun. I failed a lot, but
      learned along the way.
    </li>
    <li>
      I didn't jump from language to language. Instead I stayed in a few places
      for years and focused my learning on those tools. My 19+ year career can
      be summed up as FoxPro then Java then Python. In the middle of things I
      picked up JavaScript. Sure, I've dallied with a few things (Lisp, Haskell,
      Lua, Perl, ColdFusion, Go), but by staying focused on a small set of tools
      I'm better than mediocre.
    </li>
    <li>I coded lots. Yes, this is a repeat of #1.</li>
    <li>
      Once I got the basics of a language, I looked up best practices for each
      of them. Then I religiously adhered to them, even becoming dogmatic about
      it. In general this means my code is more easily read. More easily
      debugged. And most importantly, more easily shared.
    </li>
    <li>
      Did I mention that I coded a lot? You can never get good at anything
      unless you practice. Another repeat of #1.
    </li>
    <li>
      I got over my fear/pride of asking questions. Well, mostly, I still am
      afraid/prideful from time to time. Honestly, by asking questions you
      aren't showing what you don't know, you are showing you are willing to
      learn. Also, the simple act of figuring out how to ask a question can put
      you in the right mindset to determine the answer yourself.
    </li>
    <li>
      As soon as I asked a question, whether or not I got an answer, I coded
      some more. Code, code, code! Yet another repeat of #1
    </li>
    <li>
      Once I've gotten the hang of a language, I looked for cookbooks and/or
      pocket references on it. I prefer paper copies of tech books (everything
      else I read is electronic). The recipes in cookbooks become the foundation
      of my toolkit. The terse, easy-to-find reminders in the pocket reference
      mean less cognitive overload.
    </li>
    <li>
      I took those recipes and references and coded with them. Again and again I
      coded. In work hours or play time. Practice makes perfect! Why do I keep
      repeating #1?
    </li>
    <li>
      Over the years I've stayed with the easiest-to-learn stable IDEs/text
      editors. Yes, I know there are really powerful tools with arcane commands
      (Vim, EMACS, etc), but I don't want to have to stop what I'm doing to
      learn new tools. I want to code, not tinker with desktop tools or arcane
      text editors.
    </li>
    <li>
      And again, reference back to #1, I use the text editor to write code.
      Code, code, code! Until my fingers and hands hurt, until I've had to learn
      how to deal with carpal tunnel syndrome. Code, code, code! It's like
      learning martial arts, guitar, or anything, repetition of simple actions
      provides the confidence for you to either combine those actions into
      something greater or learn something more complex.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1 id="what-i-wish-i-had-done">What I Wish I Had Done</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Studied computer science. If I could do it all over again, that would have
      been the focus of my academic studies. It wouldn't replace anything on my
      list, the path I've defined remains the same. Code, code, code!
    </li>
    <li>
      It goes without saying I should have taken more tutorials. Nothing gives a
      kickstart like having an instructor, online or in-person, who guides you
      down the right path. Then you can code, code, code!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Practice makes perfect, right?</p>
