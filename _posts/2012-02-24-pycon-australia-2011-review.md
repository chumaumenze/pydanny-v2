    In June of 2011 I had the good fortune of having my then girlfriend, Audrey
    Roy, now fiancee,
    <a
      href="https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2011/06/im-going-to-pycon-australia.html"
      target="_blank"
      >invited to present a keynote speech at PyCon Australia 2011</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was terribly excited for her to get that invitation, and that excitement
    was compounded when they allowed me to present on
    <a

  <p>
    Travel is a passion of mine, and it's only been since 2007 that I've gotten
    a chance to do much seeing of the world. Australia was always this distant
    goal of mine, but I never thought I would get the chance to go. Fortunately,
    my assumption was wrong and we landed on August 18th in Sydney, Australia!

    Audrey
    <a href="http://audreyr.posterous.com/thank-you-pycon-au" target="_blank"
      >wrote her own statement about the event</a
    >
    right after we were done. She's good that way. Okay then, off to my own
    review. This is belated, but better late then never, right?
  </p>
  <h1 id="conference-rooms">Conference Rooms</h1>
  <p>
    The Sydney Masonic Center was the venue and it was a really curious
    building. They built it a while ago, then apparently grafted an office
    building onto the top of the temple.
    <strong>You have to see it to believe it</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main temple room was room, interesting, and fun. The acoustics, to my
    limited ear, seemed quite good. The alternative rooms for some of the tracks
    were small presentation rooms, which did quite nicely except when the
    organizers chose popular talks for small rooms and things overflowed.
    Everyone was good natured about that and we all just worked it out.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Result: Great</strong></p>
  <h1 id="speakers">Speakers</h1>
  <p>
    I'm partial but I think the opening keynote by Audrey Roy about diversity
    was wonderful. Mary Gardinar also talk about open source projects trying to
    change the world that need our support. Raymond Hettiger seriously delivered
    the goods with another version of his amazing talk about what makes Python
    great. Whatever you do, go and see it as many times as possible because he
    changes it each and every time. Richard Jones' presentation on the

      target="_blank"

    >
    was very solid too, and I'll use this as an opportunity to promote my
    <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/that" target="_blank"
      >Anti-Zen of Python</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it came time for me to present on
    <a
      href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer%60:"
      target="_blank"
      >Confessions of Joe Developer</a
    >, I finished way too early; plus me and Audrey felt the talk was not
    technical enough. Even though the reception for my talk was very positive,
    based on that experience and observation we ramped up the technical content
    for DjangoCon US and I delivered a much stronger talk. I want to thank the
    Australian Python community for being a wonderful audience.

    was incredible.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Result: Super</strong></p>
  <h1 id="conference-meals">Conference Meals</h1>
  <p>
    The night before the conference, Frends/mentors Russell Keith-Magee and
    Malcolm Tredennick took me to a sushi-train place and we gobbled down some
    very nice raw seafood. Call me silly, but sushi on moving plates just tastes
    better! Thanks guys!
  </p>
  <p>
    In between talks they served nice little sandwiches. The coffee bar had
    lovely Flat Whites and considering the quality of dairy in Australia I was
    very happy with the break food.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first night of the conference they served an amazing, amazing meal. The
    lamb was like nothing I've tasted before - my best way of describing it was
    "<em>so this is how lamb is supposed to taste</em>". We also got served
    Pavlova, which Audrey really enjoyed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last evening of the conference we went out to a famous Sydney
    gastropub/brewery and got kangaroo and crocodile pizza. The kangaroo was
    outstanding, but the alligator wasn't my thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the conference we went with Graham Dumpleton to a wonderful Dim Sum
    place and I stuffed myself silly while Audrey quizzed Graham on WSGI. I was
    sleepy for the rest of the day.
  </p>
  <p>Pounds gained? Many.</p>
  <p><strong>Result: Superb</strong></p>
  <h1 id="parties">Parties</h1>
  <p>
    There were some lovely dinners and hang-outs. It was incredible putting
    faces to names and personalities. Everyone looked as I imagined, which meant
    they looked smashing. Events tended to be lower key, which can make for some
    wonderfully nice, cozy conversation.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Result: Good</strong></p>
  <h1 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h1>
  <p>
    There was no official conference hotel so we stayed at World Hotel - in easy
    walking distance of the conference center. It wasn't cheap, but I've learned
    from painful experience that when you travel to a conference, you want to
    spend your time at the conference, not going to-and-from a cheap hotel five
    miles away.
  </p>
  <p>
    The staff of the hotel were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately they were
    working around the limitations of their building. The rooms were really tiny
    and rather stuffy. Normally that isn't an issue since we spend a lot of our
    time outside the room, but in this case Audrey was polishing her talk and
    needed a quiet room.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Result: Average but not the fault of the conference</strong></p>
  <h1 id="sprints">Sprints</h1>
  <p>
    We talked with Richard Jones about PyPI authentication issues, and he
    decided to go with OpenID. Personally, I would prefer OAUTH but I'll take
    whatever I can get. On the behalf of the community Mark Rees implemented
    OpenID on PyPI at the sprint so things like
    <a href="http://opencomparison.org" target="_blank"
      >http://opencomparison.org</a
    >
    can support the community better. One goal at PyCon 2012 is to get that
    working as another authentication system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Otherwise I closed bugs and worked lintification of the project. Audrey and
    a couple Australian PyLadies, Elena Williams and Jenny Nguyen, worked some
    core Django documentation tickets. We didn't get as much done as we hoped
    thanks to an outside distraction, but the organization of the sprints was
    top-notch.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the sprint, those crazy Australians taught us how to do a
    <strong>Tim Tam Slam</strong>. It's rather scary and not for the faint of
    heart.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Result: Great</strong></p>
  <h1 id="overall-result">Overall Result</h1>
  <p>
    The conference was run professionally. The leadership was on the ball. The
    few issues that cropped up were taken care of, certainly better then what I
    would have done. Thank you everyone who put it together or just gave us a
    great time: Tim Ansell, Richard Jones, Nick Coghlan, Russell Keith McGee,
    Graham Dumpleton, Malcolm Tredennick and many others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Australia was amazing. The people were wonderful. I wish we had more time to
    go sightseeing and relax, but we were off all too quickly. I could write a
    book about the experience.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Combined Result: Great</strong></p>
