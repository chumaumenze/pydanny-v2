    In a small, private family ceremony on December 27th, 2013 I exchanged
    wedding vows with <a href="http://audreyr.com" target="_blank">Audrey</a>
    <a href="http://audreymroy.com" target="_blank">Roy</a>.

    It was an incredible day. I'll savor the moment we promised ourselves to
    each other in matrimony forever. She is the other half of my soul, and since
    we've become husband and wife, everything has changed. The world is simply a
    better place to be.

    Audrey wore my mother's 1961 wedding dress and her wedding ring was my
    grandmother's. These symbolized the close bond Audrey has with my family. I
    was wearing a tuxedo and for the occasion taught myself how to tie a bow
    tie. The flowers were a combined effort of Audrey, her aunt, and her cousin.
    Audrey made the wedding cake figurines herself.

    We experienced so much of the world in 2013 that we don't feel inclined to
    race off to an exotic honeymoon quite yet. We are tentatively thinking of a
    road trip in the USA, but are open to suggestions.

    We're thinking of planning a fun, casual outdoor reception in late March in
    Southern California. We're not absolutely certain yet, because at big events
    you barely have time to say hello to everyone. Still, it could be fun...
