    Me and Audrey have been working hard on
    <a href="http://consumernotebook.com" target="_blank">Consumer Notebook</a>,
    a Python/Django based project. We submitted it to PyCon StartUp row and
    found out this morning we've been accepted. <strong>Hooray!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    From the
    <a
      href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012 "
      target="_blank"
      >PyCon StartUp Row winner's post</a
    >, here is a little bit of what we're about:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Have you tried researching products online recently? Search engines are
      gamed by scammy marketers. Product review sites overwhelm you with ads,
      have unreliable reviews, or dryly compare raw product specs.
      <a href="http://consumernotebook.com" target="_blank"
        >Consumer Notebook</a
      >
      is working to solve this problem. It is like Yelp for products, with
      product comparison grids inspired by the founders' open-source work on
      <a href="http://djangopackages.com" target="_blank">Django Packages</a>
      and
      <a href="http://opencomparison.org" target="_blank">Open Comparison</a>.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Just so you know, <a href="http://us.pycon.org" target="_blank">PyCon</a> in
    North America is the biggest gathering for the international Python
    community. The conference this year is in Santa Clara, California, and is
    sold-out at 1500+ attendees, but could have easily sold out several times
    that number. The talks, tutorials, and events are going to be incredible,
    and I'm delighted to be part of the PyCon experience!
  </p>
  <p>
    We look forward to sharing the StartUp Row with friends like Transifex,
    Python Packages, and
    <a href="http://www.weddinglovely.com/" target="_blank">Wedding Lovely</a>.
