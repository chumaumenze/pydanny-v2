    I've joined forces with Matt Harrison and Audrey Roy to put together the
    first ever
    <a href="http://www.pythonindiebundle.com" target="_blank"
      >Python Indie Bundle</a
    >
    sale!
  </p>
  <p>
    This bundle includes the following e-book bundles (PDF, Kindle, ePub) for
    just <strong>$24.95</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Treading on Python Volume 1: Foundations</li>
    <li>Treading on Python Volume 2: Intermediate</li>
    <li>Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Bought individually, these three books would cost you $36.95, but in honor
    of Cyber Monday we've chopped off about 33%, bringing you the awesome price
    of just <strong>$24.95</strong>!
  </p>
  <p>
    We're just indie authors who work without a publisher. We pay all the bills,
    do all the marketing, and make it or break it on our own. It's a lot of
    work, but we think the total control we have over our work speaks volumes
    for the quality of result.

    If you've been to my blog before, you probably already know about Two Scoops
    of Django that I co-wrote with Audrey Roy. However, you may not know about
    Matt Harrison's books, so I'm going to share some thoughts:
  </p>
  <p>
    Matt has a talent for explaining things related to Python. If you are still
    new to Python, his books will amplify your skills and get you to the next
    level. If you've been doing Python for a while, his intermediate book will
    illuminate how things like decorators, generators, and other great features
    of Python can be leveraged to make your code cleaner and faster. In a
    nutshell, Matt's books pay for themselves because they ramp up your skills.
