    Yet again, myself, Audrey Roy, and a small but elite cadre of volunteers are
    feverishly at work putting together another Los Angeles open source event.
    Our

      target="_blank"
      >last effort went smashingly well</a
    >, and like any good engineer, we're ready to scale up - this time to 150
    attendees!
  </p>
  <p>
    LA Open Source #5 is a day long coding event for Open Source developers of
    all languages and skill levels to come and code like fiends. They'll be
    joined by dozens of either really smart coders or nice people like me.
    Sponsors are providing food, drinks, venue, and more!
  </p>
  <p>
    RSVP at

  </p>
  <p>I'll be there to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Co-lead the event with the assistance of the awesome Los Angeles technical
      community!
    </li>
    <li>
      Code like a fiend. I plan to work on core
      <a href="http://djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a>. Maybe some
      ember.js stuff too.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>And now to open the floor to questions...</p>
  <h1 id="when-and-where">When and where?</h1>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <pre><code>Cross Campus (crosscamp.us)
820 Broadway
Santa Monica, CA
</code></pre>
  <p>When:</p>
  <pre><code>November 4th, 2012
10 AM to 9 PM
</code></pre>
  <h1 id="is-this-like-a-hackathon">Is this like a Hackathon?</h1>
  <p>
    Yup. See
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints" target="_blank"
      >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints</a
    >

  <h1 id="what-if-i-dont-have-a-project-of-my-own-to-bring-should-i-come">
    What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join and
    contribute to in order to make the world a better place. The current list of
    projects include things like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Django - in fact, this time we've got at least one core Django developer!
    </li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Rails</li>
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Pyramid</li>
    <li>Salt Stack</li>
    <li>Clojure</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 id="im-just-starting-as-a-developer-should-i-come">
    I'm just starting as a developer, should I come?
  </h1>
  <p>It depends.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>If you've never coded before</strong>, this isn't the right place.
    Instead, you might consider one of the local coding workshops or classes. In
    fact, here's a good
    <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hack-Night/" target="_blank"
      >bi-weekly hack night / study group</a
    >
    for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If you've done a tutorial or two</strong>, sprints can be a great
    way to learn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside
    experienced developers who actually need your help. A lot of projects have
    what are called 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for
    beginner developers to wet their teeth on. Things I've learned at events
    like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other things that
    have made me a better coder.
  </p>
  <h1 id="can-i-come-and-do-one-of-the-following">
    Can I come and do one of the following:
  </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Recruit.</li>
    <li>Get people to work on my private project.</li>
    <li>Get people to work on my start-up idea.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>No.</strong></p>
  <p>
    This is not a job fair or way to get free developers services, and we don't
    want unnecessary distractions.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, if you want to help sponsor we mention you on the
    official event description, in social media and many other perks. Please
    contact us at
    <a href="mailto:sponsors@laopensource.org" target="_blank"
      >sponsors@laopensource.org</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, we're considering future events that mix in business into our
    efforts. If you're interested in that sort of thing then stay tuned for more
    announcements.
  </p>
  <h1 id="what-about-sponsorship">What about sponsorship?</h1>
  <p>
    In return for sponsorship we mention your organization or person on the
    official event description, and provide many other perks including mention
    in social media.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, our attendees are well-noted for their feverish support of
    sponsors. Developer-only open source events are rare in Los Angeles, so
    attendees are incredibly grateful to those who make the event possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    If interested, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:sponsors@laopensource.org" target="_blank"
      >sponsors@laopensource.org</a
    >.
  </p>
  <h1 id="what-do-i-need-to-bring">What do I need to bring?</h1>
  <p>
    Your own functioning laptop with power cord. Neither event organizers, the
    venue, or sponsors are providing equipment. We also encourage you to bring a
    power strip labeled with your name.
  </p>
  <h1 id="im-sold-how-much-does-it-cost-and-where-do-i-register">
    I'm sold! How much does it cost and where do I register?
  </h1>
