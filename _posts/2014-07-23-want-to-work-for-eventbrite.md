    Join me,
    <a href="http://www.aeracode.org/" target="_blank">Andrew Godwin</a> (South,
    <a

    (co-founder of

    <a href="http://lanyrd.com/" target="_blank">Lanyrd</a>), and many other
    talented people at
    <a href="https://eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a>. We have
    great challenges, the kind that inspire you to rise to the occasion. We need
    you to help us overcome them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I should mention that Eventbrite is committed to giving back to the
    community. Most notably
    <a
      href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomchristie/django-rest-framework-3/posts/921581"
      target="_blank"
      >Eventbrite just contributed Â£5000 to the Django Rest Framework
      kickstarter</a
    >, or about <strong>US$8500!!</strong> We're a frequent sponsor of events
    around the world. It doesn't stop there, as Eventbrite managers during the
    discussion of any tool outside our domain of running events will ask: "<em
      >When can we open source this?</em
    >"
  </p>
  <p>
    As someone who loves working on open source, Eventbrite is the place to be.
    I say this because I know what we're planning to do in the future. If you
    join us, you'll find out sooner rather than later. ;)
  </p>
  <p>
    What's Eventbrite like as a company? Well, we're rated in the
    <strong>top 20 of best places to work</strong> in the United States. We get
    full benefits, free lunch, educational opportunities, and much more. In
    addition, I have to say that my co-workers are friendly, intelligent, always
    learning, and love to do things the right way, even if it's the hard way.

    Sure, you could go to the official Eventbrite job site, but this method is a
    fun challenge that proves to us you have the basics down. All you need to do
    is pass this little test of mine. If you fail any portion of this test we
    can't consider hiring you.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Can you work</strong> in <strong>San Francisco</strong> (USA),
      <strong>Nashville</strong> (USA), or <strong>Mendoza</strong> (Argentina)?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Do you know Python?</strong> Sorry, we aren't looking for Foxpro
      coders. Experience with git-scm, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and MySQL
      definite pluses.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >Are you able to communicate in both written and verbal English?</strong
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Are you a coder?</strong> I will throw away anything from a
      recruiter.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Can you figure out how to contact me?</strong> Eventbrite doesn't
      believe in testing applicants with puzzle logic questions. Instead, we ask
      you meaningful technical questions or to solve a coding problem. With that
      in mind, use the following to contact me:
    </li>
