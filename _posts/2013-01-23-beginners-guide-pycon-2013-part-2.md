      >

  </h1>
  <p>
    This is Part II in a series of blog posts about
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/" target="_blank">PyCon US 2013</a>. The
    goal is to provide a handy reference guide for first time attendees of the
    world's largest
    <a href="http://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> conference.
    <a
      href="https://pydanny.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html"
      target="_blank"
      >Part I</a
    >
    was mostly about
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/" target="_blank"
      >tutorials</a
    >, this post will be about registration and the first day of talks.
  </p>
  <h1 id="registration">Registration</h1>
  <p>
    If you haven't done so yet, please
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/" target="_blank"
      >register</a
    >
    now. Last year PyCon sold out way in advance, and hundreds missed the event.
    Which is a shame, because the conference is awesome!
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in mind that the money you spend on registration will go towards a very
    good thing. You see, after the costs for running PyCon are subtracted, the
    rest will go to the non-profit Python Software Foundation (<a
      href="http://python.org/psf/"
      target="_blank"
      >PSF</a
    >). In addition to supporting the Python language itself, the PSF provides
    financial aid and grants for aspiring developers around the world. Which
    means the money you spend registering for PyCon will literally change
    people's lives. This isn't an idle exaggeration, this outreach has made a
    difference for you, me, and arguably the world. I would love to say more,
    but that's an article for another day...
  </p>
  <p>Alright, on to the talks!</p>
  <h1 id="talk-attendance-guidelines">Talk Attendance Guidelines</h1>
  <p>
    At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and
    brightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some quick
    guidelines:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ask Questions!</strong> If the speaker leaves time for questions
      at the end,
      <a
        href="http://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/"
        target="_blank"
        >go and ask</a
      >!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.</strong> It's
      disconcerting to give a speech to hundreds of people staring at their
      portable electronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are
      using electronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning
      them off to look at the speaker.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Don't Heckle.</strong> It's nerve wracking going up in front of
      hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video. Heckling
      is <strong>never</strong> funny and it's a good way to lose friends and
      make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the talk, wait
      until the end and then ask your questions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Alright, that out of the way, let's take a look at what Friday, March 15th,
    has to offer in terms of beginner friendly talks...

  <p>
    The registration desk opens at 7:00 AM. Breakfast begins at 8:00 AM. From

    keynotes aren't boring - <strong>they are crazy awesome!</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In selecting these talks, I've tried to focus on the more technical ones.

  <h2 id="friday-lunch">Friday Lunch</h2>
  <p>Quick notes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Don't forget to keep your PyCon meal tickets you got when you registered
      in the morning or they won't let you into the lunch room!
    </li>
    <li>
      Sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every time I do
      this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get to meet
      <strong>amazing</strong> people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and
      you'll never get to know any of them unless you try.
