  <p>
    The second day of
    <a href="http://ph.pycon.org" target="_blank">PyCon Philippines 2012</a> had
    a really good turnout. My unofficial estimate is that we had about 90% of
    the attendees from the first day attend (with the unfortunate exception of
    most of the faculty and students of
    <a href="http://www.13hq.com/" target="_blank">Agoo Computer College</a>).
  </p>
  <p>The day started with...</p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately I don't normally take notes on lightning talks. I'm kicking
    myself now. <strong>Really hard.</strong> I'll try and relate some of the
    talks:

      Encouraged at #pyconph seeing so many people declaring themselves
      beginners and then diving in. Enthusiasm was a bit contagious.

    Primary funding for the sprints came from the
    <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation" target="_blank"
      >Django Software Foundation</a
    >
    and <a href="http://pythonsprints.com/" target="_blank">Python Sprints</a>.
    That funding went towards food, drinks, and various logistics for handling
    the estimated 200+ attendee turnout. Things sprinted on:
  </p>
  <h2 id="django">Django</h2>
  <p>
    Django had it's own dedicated and very full room (no more chairs could fit
    so I sat on the floor), with Malcolm Tredinnick leading the effort, with
    <a href="http://marconijr.com/" target="_blank">Marconi</a>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr" target="_blank">Moreto</a> helping
    out. It turned into mostly an effort to get a lot of people kick-started in
    Django. What was very heartening was watching people race through the
    tutorials on their own, and then work on projects using the framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    I suspect next year the sprints will see a lot of submissions to Django
    core.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had hoped to continue my work on Class Based View documentation, but it
    was wisely pointed out that I should focus more on helping others get moving
    in Django and other projects.
  </p>
  <h2 id="ansible">Ansible</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="http://capsunlock.net" target="_blank">Rodney</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/cocoy" target="_blank">Quillo</a> led the sprint
    on the <a href="http://ansible.github.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a> tool
    of which he is so fond. About seven people fond of engineering joined him.
    They seemed very productive and happy by day's end.
  </p>
  <h2 id="pymongo">pymongo</h2>
  <p>
    A number of developers working on embedded devices gathered to work out an
    edge case issue with pymongo. I wish I knew more about their efforts, but I
    can tell you that this sort of very serious engineering effort is very
    common amongst professional Filipino developers. Because of geography,
    telecommunications and embedded devices are much more prevalent in the
    island nation.
  </p>
  <h2 id="other-efforts">Other efforts</h2>
  <p>
    Again I'm kicking myself. There were a ton of other development going on and
    I didn't document any of it. Certainly I was busy here and there helping
    out, but this is the sort of thing you need to document at the moment. Next
    time I assure you I will be very diligent about recording the efforts of so
    many.
  </p>
  <h2 id="tutorial-room">Tutorial Room</h2>
  <p>
    About half the people stayed in what I dubbed the tutorial room. This is
    where speakers took turns going over material we had brought to the
    conference. Attendees followed along, and the diligence and focus in the
    room was very impressive. The tutorials/talks included:

  <h1 id="food-and-drinks">Food and drinks</h1>
  <p>
    I mean to mention that the breakfast, lunch, and snacks at PyCon Philippines
    2012 were pretty good. The logistic chairs had decided rather than gamble on
    the usual sort of over-priced and not-so-good professional catering service
    that most conferences rely on to the dismay of... well... everyone, to go
    with local restaurants.
  </p>
  <p>
    For dinner people went out on their own. We were lucky enough to go to Pino
    in Quezon City both times. The Kare-Kareng Bagnet was really tasty.
  </p>
  <h1 id="conference-end">Conference End</h1>
  <p>
    The conference chair, Frank Pohlmann, gave us a few well spoken words about
    how wonderful the event was to run and host. How gratifying it was to see
    the enthusiasm and dedication of the attendees, and how inspired he felt.
  </p>
  <p>Then we cheered him.</p>
  <p>
    After that it was a lot of pictures and goodbyes to many new friends. Which
    meant a lot of sad feelings about a great event coming to an end. I felt
    inspired and changed. I wasn't the same person going in as I was coming out.
    I'm more grateful for what I have, and deeply honored that I had this chance
    to bring PyCon to so many wonderful people.
