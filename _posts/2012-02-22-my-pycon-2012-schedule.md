<p>Here I was thinking that this year's PyCon wasn't going to be so busy
because I didn't submit a talk or tutorial. Ha! What the heck was I
thinking?</p>
<p>Here's what I've already got in the works.</p>
<h1 id="wednesday-march-7th">Wednesday, March 7th</h1>
<p>Me and Audrey are driving up from Los Angeles. I've wanted to do this
drive for a while, so this is very exciting. We'll arrive in the
evening and hopefully tag up with friends old and new.</p>
<h1 id="thursday-march-8th">Thursday, March 8th</h1>
<p>I'm moderating the Code Reuse panel of the Python Web Summit. <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=1c9a94&amp;t=1c9a94.43" target="_blank">Have you
submitted a question
yet</a>?</p>
<p>In the evening we'll be helping assemble bags for the conference.
That's always a blast.</p>
<h1 id="friday-march-9th">Friday, March 9th</h1>
<p>PyCon really begins! I'll be at the keynotes, and then the talks begin.
These are some of the talks I'm really leaning towards watching:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/64/" target="_blank">Introduction to
Metaclasses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/399/" target="_blank">The Art of
Subclassing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/249/" target="_blank">Data, Design,
Meaning</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/246/" target="_blank">Code Generation in Python: Dismantling
Jinja</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The problem, of course, is that all the talks look awesome. Missing some
of these talks is going to hurt.</p>
<p>In the evening we're going to the New Relic/Loggly/Skull Candy party
and hang out at the (in)famous TIP BOF.</p>
<h1 id="saturday-march-10th">Saturday, March 10th</h1>
<p>I'll be at the <a href="http://consumernotebook.com" target="_blank">Consumer Notebook</a>
<a href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html" target="_blank">Startup
Row</a>
booth all day! Come and hang out with us and all the other bright, new
companies.</p>
<p>In the evening I'm hosting the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/" target="_blank">PyCon Capoeira Open
Space</a>. We've
got a seriously large room assigned for the event, and over twenty five
people currently signed up to participate (<a href="http://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira" target="_blank">there's still room for
signups</a>). Even if you don't want to play
a musical instrument or learn/play at Capoeira, come anyway to watch.
Some of the players there have some seriously amazing skills - I can
assure you've seen them in the movies.</p>
<h1 id="sunday-march-11th">Sunday, March 11th</h1>
<p>More talks!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/482/" target="_blank">Transifex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/301/" target="_blank">Sketching a better
product</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/66/" target="_blank">Building A Python-Based Search
Engine</a></li>
<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/168/" target="_blank">Diversity in
practice</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="monday-march-12-thursday-march-15">Monday March 12 - Thursday, March 15</h1>
<p>Sprints! Nothing set in stone yet, but some ideas I've had include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch python.opencomparison.org for all of Python.</li>
<li>OpenComparison integration of PyPI OpenID, SourceForge OAUTH, and
BitBucket OAUTH.</li>
<li>Improved OpenComparison integration of the Launchpad API.</li>
<li>Implement Gitorious API for OpenComparison.</li>
<li>Implement Text Based search for OpenComparison.</li>
<li>Hack on Mongo related technologies such as django-mongonaut and some
other planned projects.</li>
</ul>
