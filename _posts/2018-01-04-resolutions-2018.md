    The last time I wrote down resolutions was way back in 2014. I had done it
    for many years at that point, dating back to even before my old blog.
    Somehow I fell out of what I consider a positive habit. Well, it's time to
    pick it up again!
  </p>
  <p>So here are my resolutions for 2018:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Weight down to 160.</li>
    <li>Work out for 60 minutes a day. I got lazy in the last year.</li>
    <li>
      Start martial arts again. Because of knee and ankle injuries, Capoeira is
      probably right out. Already up Kali/Escrima under
      <a

        >Guro</a
      >
      Mestre Xing√∫ instead.
    </li>
    <li>
      Write at least 3 books (last year we did 5 books, so this is doable!). Out
      of those, one will be about coding in some way.
    </li>
    <li>
      Blog at least once a month, about anything. Python, Django, serverless
      coding, martial arts, whatever. And with this post, January is done!
    </li>
    <li>Release some coding projects I can't talk about yet.</li>
    <li>
      Travel outside the USA. That looks to be a trip to Colombia to speak at
      <a href="https://www.pycon.co" target="_blank">PyCon Colombia</a>! If you
      are in South America, please meet me (and Audrey) there! I'll be sharing
      more details soon. :-)
    </li>
  </ol>

    note: The photo is from a light painting session I did with Audrey at the
    start of last year.
