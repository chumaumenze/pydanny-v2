    In January
    <a href="http://audreymroy.com" target="_blank">Audrey Roy</a> and I
    launched a
    <a href="http://django.2scoops.org" target="_blank">book</a> about Django
    called
    <a href="http://django.2scoops.org" target="_blank"
      >Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</a
    >. We decided to not use PayPal. Here's why:

    Open Source Events Get Burned By PayPal
  </h1>
  <p>
    PayPal has a long, sordid history of freezing the accounts of Python related
    conferences and events around the world. In fact, this article was born out
    of the fact
    <a
      href="http://blog.djangocircus.com/post/43806402173/back-on-track"
      target="_blank"
      >DjangoCon Europe 2013 had its PayPal account frozen</a
    >. In the past,
    <a href="http://2012.djangocon.eu/" target="_blank">DjangoCon Europe 2012</a
    >, Plone Conferences 2008, 2011, and at least one PyCon Australia dealt with
    the same PayPal problem (DjangoCon 2013 was forewarned and took measures to
    protect itself). We also have unconfirmed reports of other Python and Django
    events also running into problems with PayPal freezing accounts. Going with
    just confirmed conferences having issues with PayPal, this is a combined
    total of assets in excess of over US$100,000 dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's not just a Python issue either, it's an issue that
    <a href="http://conferencesburnedbypaypal.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"
      >strikes other open source languages and tools</a
    >. It's at the point now where
    <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/3898/" target="_blank"
      >conference organizers don't trust PayPal</a
    >
    and make a point telling each other to use alternative payment gateways.
  </p>
  <h1 id="fear-shame-and-paypal">Fear, Shame, and PayPal</h1>
  <p>
    The terrifying thing to consider is that I suspect that the number of
    technical conferences affected by PayPal freezes is much, much larger. My
    reasoning is that
    <strong>most conferences keep quiet about it</strong> because
    <strong
      >they're afraid that raising a fuss will annoy PayPal's anti-fraud
      division</strong
    >. Let's also face the fact that
    <strong
      >most people feel ashamed when bank accounts they are responsible for get
      frozen</strong
    >, so probably don't publicize the issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    The usual way conferences deal with these lockouts is conference organizers
    beg and borrow from friends, family, take second mortgages, local banking
    institutions, and pray that PayPal will eventually free their account. When
    you deal with a hostile, inaccessible payment gateway who won't let you
    provide for the hundreds or even thousands of people who paid you their hard
    earned money, it's the only way to get by.
  </p>
  <h1 id="the-needs-of-paypals-anti-fraud-division">
    The 'Needs' of PayPal's Anti-Fraud Division
  </h1>
  <p>
    While I could respect the needs of PayPal's anti-fraud division when dealing
    with non-fungible products like ticket sales, it's
    <strong>simply unacceptable</strong> that prominent conferences for open
    source projects are treated this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    The software represented by these conferences drives the modern e-commerce
    world, including the myriad of systems that use PayPal to process sales. Yet
    PayPal continues to burn open source conferences year after year, and we've
    never heard of any conference outreach by their so-called 'developer
    evangelists' when a conference's account is frozen.
  </p>
  <h1 id="legal-recourse-against-paypal-is-folly">
    Legal recourse against PayPal is folly
  </h1>
  <p>
    Ask any lawyer and they'll basically say against PayPal you have no options.
    PayPal has an army of lawyers and in most places isn't a bank, meaning your
    course of action is constrained from the beginning by your agreeing to
    PayPal's Terms of Service (TOS). Also, in the United States, their TOS
    prevents you from joining a class action lawsuit against them. Whether or
    not that TOS clause is enforceable in court, the fact that it is in their
    TOS greatly reduces any faith I might have had in them because it paints a
    picture of a company hostile to my needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In talking to authors and entrepreneurs, we've just heard (and read) too
    many horror stories. For merchants of non-fungible goods such as digital
    goods like the e-book I co-authored, PayPal seems even less trustworthy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Which means using PayPal places us at an unacceptable risk. We simply don't
    have the deep pockets to deal with PayPal freezing our funds for sales lost
    from a more reliable distribution system such as
    <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a> that powers our
    sales through <a href="https://gumroad.com" target="_blank">Gumroad</a>.
  </p>
  <h1 id="it-is-wrong-to-use-paypal">It is Wrong to Use PayPal</h1>
  <p>
    Considering PayPal's unacceptable behavior in regards to the open source
    community I love and merchants who try to work in their system, I feel it is
    wrong to support PayPal. Audrey agrees, and so our policy of not using
    PayPal to sell the book is set.

    There was a day when Microsoft had what seemed to be an unassailable lock on
    the commercial software world. On many levels, Microsoft is a shadow of its
    former self, and I contend it wasn't just Apple's competition. Instead,
    Microsoft's contempt for their own customers and the developer community
    hurt them just as much.
  </p>
  <p>
    PayPal is on the same path of self-destruction. The've gone from the
    <a

      target="_blank"
      >scrappy company</a
    >
    helping people grow their business to the monolithic overlord that kills
    businesses and well-meaning events.
  </p>
  <p>
    PayPal's demise won't happen this year, or the next, but every time they
    damage their customer base and the developer community it's another nail in
    the coffin. I submit that unless PayPal changes its ways, within 5 years
    PayPal will be a shadow of its former self as the army of growing
    competitors such as <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>,
    <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/" target="_blank"
      >Balanced Payments</a
    >, <a href="https://www.wepay.com/" target="_blank">wepay</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/" target="_blank">Payoneer</a> expands
    their availability and options around the world.
  </p>
  <h1 id="what-paypal-can-do-for-conferences">
    What PayPal Can Do for Conferences
  </h1>
  <p>
    PayPal does have to worry about ticket sales for bogus events, since that
    separates people from their money, but identifying real conferences is easy:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      PayPal developer evangelists and community managers need to track every
      valid developer event in the world. It's the job of people in these roles
      to have the connections and subject matter expertise to identify real
      events from fake ones.
    </li>
    <li>PayPal needs to sponsor these events. Why? See point #3.</li>
    <li>
      PayPal's anti-fraud division needs to be informed that any PayPal
      sponsored event is off-limits.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1 id="what-paypal-can-do-for-small-business">
    What PayPal Can Do for Small Business
  </h1>
  <p>
    PayPal has its developer evangelists, community managers, and marketing
    departments working hard. However, at the end of the day, if you treat your
    customers with disrespect and a lack of trust, none of that matters. Bad
    press and market forces will see their revenues drop as customers will
    migrate to solutions that are more trustworthy and less antagonistic.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that PayPal needs to revise how its anti-fraud division
    communicates with people who have frozen accounts. They need to change the
    adversarial pose they take with their own customers to one that is
    collaborative.
