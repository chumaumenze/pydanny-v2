    A year ago today
    <a href="http://about.me/malcolmt" target="_blank">Malcolm Tredinnick</a>,
    core contributor to Django suddenly passed away. He was a mentor, and more
    importantly, a good friend.
  </p>
  <p>Here are some of my memories of Malcolm.</p>
  <h1 id="djangocon-us-september-2010">DjangoCon US: September 2010</h1>
  <p>
    This is where Audrey and I first met Malcolm. We ended up spending a good
    amount of the conference with him just hanging out and having a good time. I
    remember being honored that such a luminary wanted to spend time with us,
    yet was more delighted in discovering a good friend.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the conference, he peered into the nascent code base of
    <a href="https://www.djangopackages.com" target="_blank"
      >djangopackages.com</a
    >
    and asked some pointed questions. We justified a few design decisions, and
    he agreed, and we saw him using similar techniques later. He gave us some
    great pointers on things we could do, and I believe we implemented all of
    them.
  </p>

    Malcolm and I worked together on a project in 2010. During this time we had
    a number of email and chat discussions. Going over them now I'm impressed by
    his friendship and generosity of knowledge. I know he was terribly busy but
    yet he always had time for me in 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
    After about 15 emails where I addressed him as 'Malcom', Malcolm finally got
    me to consistently spell his name correctly with a single sentence:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      You might be amazed at how cranky it makes me when people try to spell
      Malcolm with only one "l".
    </p>
    <p>:-)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This was Malcolm: Acerbic yet tempered with a smile.</p>

    We had just arrived in Sydney. Our first overseas trip together! Audrey was
    giving the opening keynote at PyCon Australia. She wanted to practice her
    speech but I was restless. So she suggested that I go out for dinner,
    specifically sushi train with Malcolm Tredinnick and Russell Keith-Magee. I
    don't remember anything about the food, but I do remember having a great
    time with good friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the conference one evening Audrey and I spent a few hours with just
    Malcolm walking around Sydney. None of us wanted it to end. The time spent
    together outside of the insane pace of a conference was a poignant reminder
    that even with email, chat, and IRC, there was still thousands of miles
    between us.

    On his own dollar, Malcolm had dropped everything to attend. He spoke, he
    taught, and he made many friends. I have to admit being jealous of the
    students in the Django tutorial he taught because they got to spend time
    with him. ;)
  </p>
  <p>
    It was our last time with Malcolm, and it was so brief, so limited. I was
    okay with that because I thought I would get a chance to see him again.

    we wrote for Malcolm, you can see that his presence is an integral part of
    Two Scoops of Django. He coached us, guided us, forced us to dig deeper and
    deeper into source code. Of special note is the database chapter (excluding
    the 1.6 edition transactions), which he really focused on.
