  <p>
    New to Python and thinking about going to the upcoming
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/" target="_blank">PyCon US</a> for the
    first time? You know, that big
    <a href="http://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> conference taking
    place near San Francisco in March?
  </p>
  <p>
    Or perhaps you signed up already and are getting worried about being
    overwhelmed by hundreds of tutorials, talks, and activities?
  </p>
  <p>
    No worries! This multi-part guide will aid you in getting the most out of
    attending one of the best technical conferences on the planet. I'm going to
    share how to get through the whole event in good shape and cover some
    incredible beginner friendly events.
  </p>
  <h1 id="the-basics">The Basics</h1>
  <p>
    First off,
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/" target="_blank"
      >register</a
    >
    already! PyCon US sold out last year around this time. Don't be left out in
    the cold. Buy your ticket now before it's too late!
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that you've got that done, keep in mind that Python has two days of
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/" target="_blank"
      >tutorials</a
    >, three days of
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/talks/" target="_blank">talks</a
    >, and four days of
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/" target="_blank"
      >sprints</a
    >. <strong>Nine days of Python!</strong> The trick is to not get exhausted
    or sick. Therefore, do the following every day of the conference:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Take at least one shower. Please.</li>
    <li>
      Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different people
      at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!
    </li>
    <li>
      Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your brain is
      going to go into learning overdrive.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    In addition, PyCon US also has a
    <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank"
      >code of conduct</a
    >. I like to sum it up as, "Act professionally." Whether or not you agree
    with codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one and it will be
    enforced.
  </p>
  <p>Alright, enough basics, let's get onto tutorials!</p>
  <h1 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h1>
  <p>
    Tutorials take place on March 13th and 14th. They each cost $150 but are
    well worth the price. The following are the talks I believe are best suited
    for beginners.
  </p>

    <li>
      For novice programmers start with Jessica McKellar's

      the road to being a Python developer.

      If you're new to Python, you need to learn the Python environment. This

      covers this in
