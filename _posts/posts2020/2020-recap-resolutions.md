This is my recap of 2019, as well as my resolutions for 2020.

## Recap of 2019

### My Daughter Was Born

In January of this year Uma Roy Greenfeld came into this world at 8 lbs 5 oz (3770 grams). Words cannot express the sublime joy I feel watching her grow and learn. The changes and disruption to my life has been outmatched by just how rich my existence has become.

Being a parent of a newborn has changed my thinking. It's driving some of the plans I share with Audrey Roy Greenfeld for 2020 and beyond. More on that will be posted with the new year.

### My Father Passed Away

Theodore "Ted" Greenfeld passed away in June at age 84. I learned a lot of life lessons from him - there's so much to say. Soon I'll post the eulogy I wrote for him, as well as publish his writings.

### I Like Static Typing

In 2004-2005 I nearly stopped being a programmer due to frustrations with J2EE-style Java and static typing. Nothing against Java, it just wasn't for me. Python was Introduced to me at NASA in the summer of 2005 and kept me in my chosen career. While I dallied in Golang six years ago, the typing made me unhappy.

Well, in late 2019 I participated in hackathons using both [Kotlin](./thoughts-on-kotlin) and [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and had tons of fun. The C# is especially empowering to me, as it has meant I've started to write games with the [Unity3d](https://unity.com/) platform. 

### I Ate Coconut

For most of my life I've been allergic to coconut. In the past few years eating coconut been less of an issue for me. As of the middle of 2019 the allergy is gone.  

### I Travelled

I went to Africa for the first time! I was there to attend the very first [PyCon Africa](https://africa.pycon.org/) in Accra, Ghana. What a wonderful experience - I enjoyed the people, sights, and food.

I returned to Wellington, New Zealand to give a keynote at [Kiwi PyCon 2019](https://python.nz/). Audrey gave a keynote there in 2011, which means if we follow the pattern my daughter Uma will give a keynote there in 2027. In any case, it was so much fun reconnecting with old friends and making new ones. 

Since it's so close to me, we've gone to Mexico every year since 2010 and 2019 was no different. This time it was to the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula to visit Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum. We even took the time to visit [PyCun, the Cancun Python group](./meeting-python-devs-in-cancun). 

Within the USA I visited upstate New Jersey, New York City, and Las Vegas, Nevada.

### Embraced Fitness Again

For a number of years I haven't been consistent with staying in shape. My weight went up and a lot of my clothes stopped fitting. Of greater concern is I want to be a strong, fit role model for my daughter. So in late 2019 I really jumped back into fitness, starting a mix of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and Yoga. The Yoga helps with some nagging injuries and the BJJ llows me to express my competitive nature in a healthy way. If I visit your area or [you visit mine](https://xlvcbmartialarts.com/), let's roll as friendly competitors. 

Yes, my clothes are fitting again.

## Resolutions for 2020

I know everyone doesn't do this kind of thing, but I always do.

### Travel to New Places

It's been years since I've been anywhere new within my own homeland of the USA. Time to see something new. My dream would be to do it in an electric vehicle,
