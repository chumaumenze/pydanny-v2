    I'm extremely excited. I've wanted to go to Argentina for years. It's a
    beautiful country filled with magnificent culture, lovely architecture,
    great food, superb wine, and wonderful people. Speaking of which, I can't
    wait to finally put faces to people I've gotten to know over the internet.

  <p>Hasta pronto!</p>
