    While
    <a href="http://audreyr.com/" target="_blank">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a> and I
    were contemplating our next Two Scoops Press book topic, it came down to a
    decision between Pyramid, Flask, and mythical creatures. Inspired by
    Django's magical flying pony, Pyramid's scary alien dude, and even the idea
    of a magical Flask pouring out wonderful projects, we've decided to go with
    mythical creatures.

    Specifically, we're writing about goblins, hence the title of this blog
    post.

  <p>
    What that means is that the next book we publish will be fantasy. Going
    forward all the books we write will be fiction.

    book, it will be a fantasy about a magical flying pony who eats ice cream.

    even more.

    Since this is a technical blog, I'll be moving my fiction writing based
    articles to my author blog at
