    Like the title of this blog post says, for Bitcoin purchases we're offering
    a 25% discount for purchases of
    <a
      href="https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11"
      target="_blank"
      >Two Scoops of Django</a
    >. That puts the ebook version at $34.36 and the autographed hardcopy at
    $38.36. Pretty awesome, right? If you want to take advantage of this awesome
    deal, the Bitcoin discount is applied during checkout.

    Combining the Bitcoin Discount With the Bulk Discount
  </h1>
  <p>
    Yes, the Bitcoin discount can be combined with
    <a
      href="https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11?variant=42846677327"
      target="_blank"
      >bulk orders</a
    >. So if you order 15 books or more, you get both the 20% bulk discount and
    the 25% bitcoin discount. That means each book is bought at $28.77 versus
    $47.95! Furthermore, bulk orders are shipped free to anywhere in the world.
    This makes it an incredible deal for companies, organizations, and user
    groups.
