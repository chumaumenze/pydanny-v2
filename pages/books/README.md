# Books

Writing is a passion of mine, so over the years I've seen a few books published

## Technical Works

I co-wrote an ice-cream-themed book series on Django with my wife, Audrey Roy Greenfeld. The most current version is for Django 1.11, the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of the framework. That means this book is good until at least April of 2020!
