# About

I do Python, Django, and JavaScript out of Los Angeles, California. I love to read, write, hang out with my wife, and play at Capoeira and Eskrima. I am a total Space and NASA Geek. I used to attend lots of software industry events, but these days I go to perhaps one per year.

I've written a few [books](/pages/books/) and [courses](/pages/courses/).
